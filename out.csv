New Moons Distribution (Round 9 Proposal),https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l1k5yq/new_moons_distribution_round_9_proposal/,84,CryptoCurrency,339,"UPDATE: Following [this community-approved distribution proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kj2ij0/poll_bonus_karma_for_people_that_keep_moons_in/), people who claim Moons in the previous distribution round and hold them (i.e. don't transfer them) get up to a 20% bonus on their karma. This update has been applied to this round.

\--

Moons are r/CryptoCurrency's version of Community Points. [Community Points](https://reddit.com/community-points) are a way for users to be rewarded for their contributions to the subreddit, and they can be used on premium features in the community.

Moons are distributed every 4 weeks based on contributions people make to r/CryptoCurrency. For every distribution, Reddit publishes karma data as a default measure of contribution. The community can review the data and optionally propose an alternative distribution, if they wish.

This distribution is based on karma earned from 2020-12-23 to 2021-01-19. [Here is the data.](https://reddit-meta-production.s3.amazonaws.com/distribution/publish/CryptoCurrency/round_9_proposed.csv)

To propose an alternative distribution:

* You can create a CSV with alternative contribution scores or propose changes to the algorithm used to calculate them from karma (as long as the changes can be implemented easily).
* The amount of Moons distributed to a user will be proportional to their contribution score. Contribution scores cannot be negative.
* Make a poll to have the community vote on your proposal. Include an accurate description of the changes you are proposing.
* In order to pass, the winning option in the poll must meet the decision threshold (minimum number of Moons in support). If it is in favor of the change, it becomes the official contribution measurement (unless there is evidence of abuse in the vote, such as bribery). Algorithm changes will carry forward to future distributions.
* In case of multiple polls passing, the one with the most Moons cast in favor will be the official one.
* If no alternative passes, the data provided here will become official.

The contribution scores for this round will be finalized on 2021-01-27. Any poll proposing an alternative needs to be completed by then.

After the scores are finalized, Reddit will sign the data and publish the final, official data. After that, people will be able to claim their Moons through the Vault in the Reddit mobile app.",2021-01-21 11:54:37

Questions from a Crypto Skeptic,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l2xsit/questions_from_a_crypto_skeptic/,53,CryptoCurrency,46,"I come in peace. 

I‚Äôm interested in cryptocurrency, but many of the claims about its potential as an investment leave me wondering if I‚Äôm seeing the same thing others are. I also know I don‚Äôt know everything. Instead of shaking my cane at all the youngsters making a fortune with their internet money, I want to see if I can learn more. 

Let me also preface this by saying that I‚Äôm generally interested in cryptocurrency. I think cryptocurrency is going to be useful, both for its anonymity and for cutting out costs from the traditional financial system (e.g. fees for converting dollars to euros, time spent waiting for transactions to clear, etc.). I‚Äôm also intrigued by the potential of smart contracts to automate some transactions, though I think some of the bullish arguments for these are overstated. We‚Äôre not going to get rid of contract law.

My skepticism of Bitcoin (and other coins) comes from the idea that it‚Äôs going to make you rich, which is the majority of the talk I hear around the topic these days. I‚Äôll lay out why I‚Äôm not convinced by the ‚Äúget rich‚Äù case for Bitcoin (and it would apply to any other cryptocurrency). Maybe you all can set me straight. This is all pretty basic, so don‚Äôt expect some sort of novel argument. I just tend to see the crypto community dunking on people who claim Bitcoin will fail because it will be hacked or that it will be banned and so on, when some of the basics seem more pressing.
 
**The Currency Paradox.** One of the biggest bull cases for Bitcoin is that it‚Äôs the currency of the future. But for it to be a functional currency its price has to be stable. No one is going to spend it if it could be worth double or more in a few months, yet people are owning it precisely because they hope for it to double or more in a few months. At some point its price will need to flatten and be boring and predictable for it to be a functional currency. That will neuter the investment thesis. I‚Äôm also seeing a lot of related arguments that Bitcoin is the new gold or a store of value, but the same reasoning applies. No one is going to protect their wealth by putting it in an asset that regularly crashes. It may turn into an alternative asset used for diversification, not entirely unlike gold, but it will still need stability. 

**The Fiat Currency Obituary.** You might reason that Bitcoin will stabilize as a global currency when fiat currencies disappear. The logic is something like this: If Bitcoin replaces fiat currencies (~$37 trillion in circulation?) then it will have to be worth several million per coin, making early adopters wealthy in this new system. Now, I can‚Äôt ‚Äúprove‚Äù that fiat currencies aren‚Äôt going anywhere, but I want to note their demise is far from a certainty. 

People have been predicting the end of fiat currencies for decades, long before Bitcoin ever existed. I suspect many people have suddenly found these fringe arguments more convincing now that they have a financial stake in the outcome. Of course, it‚Äôs possible these prognosticators weren‚Äôt wrong, just early. But your great-great-great-grandkids could wind up saying that about you too.

Governments have a very strong self-interest in maintaining their own currencies, tools to enforce its use (taxes must be paid in the currency), and have militaries to protect their people and secure their existence. While there are plenty of cranks who hate the Fed and think it manipulates the dollar too much, most people are pretty comfortable with their cash. There would have to be something in the order of an interwar Germany hyperinflation or something like the 1997 SE Asian currency crisis, but for the major developed economies, for there to be serious pressure to flee fiat currencies. I‚Äôm not saying it can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt happen, but it‚Äôs a longshot.  

It‚Äôs possible Bitcoin could stabilize as a more niche currency, something that solves a specific problem like the obnoxious fees charged for exchanging currencies abroad or something in that vein. That would lower the dramatic price predictions, though. And unless you‚Äôre active in whatever area Bitcoin is used in, you‚Äôll still need to convert it to dollars to enjoy the fruits of being early.

**It‚Äôs Mostly Paper Profits Right Now.** Yes, lots of people have gotten rich from Bitcoin, but not everyone drooling at the current valuation can cash out at that price. Some people converted their Bitcoin to dollars during the latest peak and have enjoyed their riches. If a lot more Bitcoin owners decided they‚Äôre ready to collect their winnings at $32,000 then the price will crash again. When you see lots of people‚Äôs goals for owning Bitcoin is to convert it to dollars to pay debts, buy a house, buy a Lambo, whatever, you realize not every Bitcoin owner will have this opportunity until Bitcoin is a functional currency (see above), which could be never.

You might say the same is true of the stock market, and there are some similarities. Here‚Äôs the difference: Companies have assets, including future profits, that backstop their stock‚Äôs value. If I was the lone shareholder of Apple I would be filthy rich whether there was anyone to sell the stock to or not. They made around $60 billion in profits last year and that would be all mine. Bitcoin‚Äôs value is more speculative and I need more people willing to pay more for it than I did or I can‚Äôt realize that value. These people will eventually dry up unless Bitcoin develops more functional value. 

As long as Bitcoin remains a speculative asset there are going to be winners and losers, people who cash out with extraordinary gains and people who‚Äôve sunk more money in than they can get back. 

**It‚Äôs Just Math.** I see a lot of formulas and mathematical jargon used to justify supercharged price predictions for Bitcoin. That‚Äôs all fine, but I suspect some of this is meant to put a scientific veneer on what amounts to guesswork or enforce an insider/outsider dynamic (Bitcoin skeptics just don‚Äôt understand math!). 

The problem here is that making accurate predictions is incredibly hard, even with an ironclad model and perfect data. It gets even harder when you factor in the uncertainty of human behavior. Imagine the difficulty in trying to forecast the 2032 presidential election or what market share Tesla will have in 2040. You can certainly make an educated guess and there‚Äôs lots of data to draw from. But there is always going to be a big ‚Äúif‚Äù justifying even the most complex sounding model. Just because a model spits out numbers doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs right. 

One of the more popular of these is the stock-to-flow model predicting Bitcoin hitting $1 million per coin by 2040. One of the selling points is that it predicts Bitcoin‚Äôs price with 95% accuracy. That sounds great. Unfortunately, this is a meaningless number by itself. There‚Äôs a lot more behind convincing statistical research than finding a line of best fit between two variables. As any number of p-hacking scandals can attest, finding ‚Äústatistically significant‚Äù relationships between variables, sometimes totally unrelated variables, isn‚Äôt hard. I‚Äôm willing to wager an enterprising sleuth could find a similar relationship between the log price of Bitcoin and many other variables. In fact, the author of the stock-to-flow post does it in the same post.

What would be more convincing is a strong justification for analyzing a relationship between these two variables with robust statistical tests that rule out other explanatory factors. Even then it may have very little predictive power. Instead, the author plucks a metric from commodity analysis as a proxy for ‚Äúscarcity,‚Äù while simultaneously dismissing the utility of analyzing Bitcoin as a commodity, then does a basic regression between the two variables and voila, Bitcoin will hit $1 million. I wouldn‚Äôt put much faith in that analysis. And it seems to be representative of many of the ""just do the research"" arguments I see for Bitcoin's future. 

***

Based on my reasoning above, my investment thesis in Bitcoin is this: It‚Äôs a speculative asset to buy with money you can afford to lose. You can make money from other speculators driving the price higher in the near term, when/if it begins functioning as a currency in the long term (where it could be a niche function like international transfers or could happen well after you‚Äôre dead and gone), or as a hedge against catastrophe like a global currency crisis, where you may have much bigger problems. This is not a lot different than a financial roulette wheel: It‚Äôs fun to play, but you wouldn‚Äôt put your mortgage on it. 

Now, where have I gone wrong? Help me see the light.",2021-01-23 11:12:19

Don't check your portfolio and prices every 5 minutes. It is not healthy!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l2b0hc/dont_check_your_portfolio_and_prices_every_5/,3024,CryptoCurrency,577,"The title says it all.

Many of us have been in the same situation in 2017 as the one we are in now. Four years ago I was checking prices every 5 minutes, imagining and calculating how big my future imaginary gains would be. Some nights when prices skyrocketed I literally couldn't sleep properly. Other nights I was worried about not selling the evening before, wondering how much the market will fall while I sleep.

If you are in this for the long-term, don't do this to yourself. Honestly, it is okay to be interested in crypto, read about it, discuss it, etc.

But being obsessed with it, constantly checking prices, calculating future profits is not a healthy thing to do. It consumes a great proportion of your time and energy, and it's basically an emotional rollercoaster.

"I had to deal with a bank today, and my experience was the reason why crypto is so important for the future of how we handle money.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l34l3s/i_had_to_deal_with_a_bank_today_and_my_experience/,10,CryptoCurrency,10,"Today I had to take a withdrawal out of my 401k, I‚Äôm in my 30‚Äôs but I‚Äôm having a baby and I need the cash in this Covid times. The 10% federal tax penalty should be waived by the event of having a baby, so it‚Äôs worth it. It‚Äôs an old 401k and isn‚Äôt a lot of our future retirement and it made sense.

So I call the big bank that manages the retirement account. Everything goes smoothly until the the phase where the phone banker is going to do an ACH. He can‚Äôt get my account information at my credit union to send back a verification. The only other option is a check for a huge amount of money getting sent(get this) by regular mail... no certified mail, no fedex signature, just regular mail. I refused to do that. So he told me I should call my credit Union and see why they are kicking back the ACH. So he gives me a number and his name where I can call him back so I don‚Äôt have to explain everything to another banker.

I call my credit Union and they are like. There is no record of an attempted ACH, and for me to recall the other bank to get some sort of transaction number. So I recall the big bank and ask to talk to the same guy, surprise surprise they can‚Äôt get me back to the same guys. So I have to explain the whole thing to a new person. So she explains that the reason it didn‚Äôt go through is that this big bank can‚Äôt send an ACH to my credit Union because of a few dollars of fees they would incur... and so I have another bank account at another big bank that I have from a while ago and I still keep it active for whatever reason. So I am like ok please send it to this account. Well this bank ALSO wasn‚Äôt in their approved list of banks to send an ACH to. So I‚Äôm like ‚Äúyou are telling me that two of the biggest banks in the Country will not communicate with each other? And because of this, you are forcing me to accept a check sent to me in the mail with a Substantial amount of money?‚Äù And she‚Äôs like ‚Äúwell we aren‚Äôt forcing you...‚Äù ummmmm I‚Äôm giving them 2 bank very viable bank options and they are refusing to send to them because they aren‚Äôt in their very small network of banks they send money to.

So at this point I‚Äôm like, ‚Äúlet me speak to your manager.‚Äù And she puts me on hold for half an hour.... at the end of the half hour she comes back on and instead of having a manager she explains that she was looking in the wrong place of the list and that she thinks she found the bank in their acceptable list to send ACH. She then asks ME if it‚Äôs the same bank, like I know??? It‚Äôs the legal name of one of the largest banks in the country and their branding for the name they use for their customers is not the same. So she was confused by this. I will tell you it‚Äôs a very well known bank, if I told you want bank you would laugh. So now we get past that. And I ask ‚Äúok so how much are you depositing into my account after fees and taxes withheld?‚Äù She refuses to tell me....???? I‚Äôm being asked to sign off on an ACH transfer without knowing the amount of the transfer... that to me sounds sketchy, like hidden fees and weird shenanigans. 

I‚Äôm not a huge fan of big banks, I have repeatedly had to fight fees for random shit over the years. Accounts being opened without my approval. It‚Äôs happened at all the big banks and finally I just moved to a credit Union. So the trust is already broken.

So I ask ‚Äúok well what are the taxes and fees you will be deducting from my withdrawal?‚Äù And she says, ‚Äúwell maybe this one and maybe this one...‚Äù 

‚ÄúOk what do you mean maybe‚Äù so we go back and forth about this for like another half hour. Her answers to my questions are very dodgy as to not accidentally give something away. She can‚Äôt tell me when my money will exit market fluctuations, she can‚Äôt tell me what taxes they will be taking out and which ones I will owe retroactively. The importance of this is that I expect to have the 10% penalty waived and I don‚Äôt want them taking this out now, I would rather argue I don‚Äôt owe it while the money is in my bank account rather than argue that the government should send me back the money. 

At the end I finally we just like ‚Äúok you can‚Äôt tell me anything about even the Amount of the ACH you are going to be sending me... just send it‚Äù the last thing we end with is, if the ACH doesn‚Äôt go through they will be sending me a check in the regular mail, I ask if it can be certified mail, the answer is no.

FUCK BANKS. Seriously I hope crypto fucks them all. I yearn for the day that the last person withdrawals their money from the banks and they fuck right off into nothingness. The big ones need to be broken up immediately they are predators and if you look the other way for a second they start with fees and Nickel and dime you like crazy.

They make lots of bogus claims on their website but that's all there is really, one website. I have tried to contact them and when I asked more about the lack of support for their claims they went awol.  These guys are virtually invisible on the internet and they're trying to convince people to transfer btc into a new wallet and link it to their website so they can steal your btc.

MOON Proposal - BIAS Comment Moon distribution towards lenghtier comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l2n1ea/moon_proposal_bias_comment_moon_distribution/,38,CryptoCurrency,41,"There was a similar proposal a few months back that didn't pass - as it just wanted to reduce comment karma in general as the OP believed that would produce more quality content.

I would like to propose an augmented version of this proposal, where the distribution to comments is weighted based on something as simple as the word length of the comment - to create a BIAS towards lengthier and more in-depth comments, which hopefully will incentivize MORE quality content, as well as make it more blatantly obvious to mods whenever someone is just spamming to farm karma as they would more then likely then write long nonsensical comments.

**My initial proposal for this is that if we consider the current distribution of moons for comment karma - the commenter would get:**

* 10% of the allocation if the comment is shorter then 10 words
* 25% of the allocation if the comment is between 10-25 words
* 50% of the allocation if the comment is between 25-50 words
* 100% of the allocation if the comment is longer then 50 words

This shouldn't penalize people writing helpful, quality comments as they will more then likely be over the 50 word limit anyways - its not alot, it should however greatly penalize people who write short cheers for whatever the flavor of the day is, or just spams 'Coin X is over sum X!!!!' for cheap karma.

And even so, there would still be moons distributed to people who spam - so we dont discourage their enthusiasm, but it wouldn't any longer be a cheap way to farm moons.

I try to mix in the most popular projects, along with some long shots. Sometimes I even feature projects I personally am not a fan of, just for the sake of conversation. I feel it is important for us to focus on the pros and cons of all projects, even if that sometimes means playing devil's advocate. At this point, I plan to try to continue making these posts until I have completed a full year.¬†

-If you decide to reply, please add something more than, ""scam"" or ""this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020"". Please say why. If it is a scam, link or show evidence. If you feel it is a true moonshot, what makes this project special with that sort of potential? It seems many people within this community only promote projects they are financially invested in, while trash talking coins they do not hold bags.¬†


-I strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. There is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. You may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. I know I certainly did!

That's all besides the point. What I realized when trying to log back in to coinbase is that it's requiring 2FA and the only 2FA app I used was google's authenticator. Unfortunately, with a broken phone and not transferring things to a new phone, I can't just import an existing account. When I log into google and try setting up 2FA on my computer, both my accounts act as if it isn't activated. So I'm not sure if the authenticator is separate from that or not. I guess, if I can't access my 2FA its not the end of the world. If I remember correctly it's just the exchanges that I had set up with 2FA.

In Q4 of 2020, the issuance of four new stablecoins were announced to the Stellar network.

‚óè Argentine Peso (ARST) and Brazilian Real (BRLT), issued by ‚ÄãSettle Network‚Äã: The first stablecoins for Argentina and Brazil went live in November of 2020. Both are fully-backed by domestic currencies and preserve close 1:1 rate between them and local currencies, involving bank grade KYC verification, AML controls and blockchain monitoring.

‚óè Euro (EURB), issued by ‚ÄãBitbond‚Äã and ‚ÄãBankhaus von der Heydt‚Äã: In December 2020, Bitbond and Bankhaus von der Heydt (BVDH) announced the first stablecoin issued directly by a banking institution on Stellar and one of the first of its kind in the crypto market. The Euro (EUR) stablecoin (EURB) is ‚Äãlive‚Äã and available today on the Stellar network.

‚óè US Dollar (USDC), issued by ‚ÄãCircle‚Äã: The Centre Consortium announced Stellar as an official chain for USDC, one of the world‚Äôs leading compliant and regulated digital dollar stablecoins. It is expected to be live in Q1 of 2021.

TLDR: Stellar is being used in real life by moving money from Singaporean Dollar to Philippine Peso. More stablecoins are added to Stellar including Argentine Peso, Brazilian Real, and Euro while USDC is expected to come to Stellar this Feb 2021.

Crypro for news articles,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l30884/crypro_for_news_articles/,2,CryptoCurrency,0,"I don't want this to be political, but the lies and misinformation from the news media last several years as well as the Australian government insisting Google pays media companies for linking to their sites has got me thinking, can we bypass traditional media with a blockchain? I think it would work like this:

1. Article is written and submitted    
2. For article to be accepted in the chain, proof of work would need to be found by several miners    
3. Successful miners vote on whether to include article in blockchain.  Their vote for this article is added to the blockchain (but not readable) until the required number of votes is reached    
4. When number of votes is reached, payments of Newschain coins are issued to all successful miners who voted with the majority (whether to accept or reject article, this is to avoid miners accepting all articles just to get paid).  
5. If article was accepted, the writer/publisher also gets a payment of newschain coin (if rejected they get nothing and article is not published)    

This also opens up the possibility for a multitude of third-party Newschain readers.  I think this system would go some way to improve the general quality of reporting.. unless the majority has an appetite for bullshit.    
note: readers can only read accepted articles, but miners can read any article that they successfully mine",2021-01-23 13:14:00

A different mental approach to this bull run.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l2o49r/a_different_mental_approach_to_this_bull_run/,13,CryptoCurrency,34,"I am sure this post will get plenty of downvotes, but please read the entire post before downvoting into oblivion. 

Back in August 2017, I YOLO'd 20k (my life savings) into Bitcoin and by October of 2017 I had discovered the illustrious, lucrative altcoins. By January of 2018, I was sitting on a stack of 256k worth of Ark, Nano, as well as many other alts. I had fallen in love with the concept of fast, low cost payments without the need of a trusted third party. I had gotten away from Bitcoin because of the expensive fees and long confirmation times. Needless to say, 9 months later my 256k was worth 17k. I was devastated. I believed, however, and continued to DCA my hard earned income over 3 years and have now far surpassed my old ATH. I would be a millionaire if I had just stuck with BTC.

Now, in 2021, I still hodl a few bitcoins but am still mainly in alts. I dont see 17-100 dollar fees and 4-48 hour wait times as the future of cash. I do see it for digital gold, so I still hodl some. I hodl most of my portfolio in coins that have low or no cost tx fees and quick confirmation times (scaleable). I also hodl dcr and xmr because I think they are better POW coins than BTC. I never bought into the defi hype, with the exception of LINK which I sold for a 19x profit. 

I strongly believe in the 4 year cycle and will be selling most of my stack in december 2021-january 2022. There is no reason thus far to believe the 4 year cycle will break this time around. In fact, what just happened with Bitcoin shows that the 4 year cycle is likely in tact. Btc will shoot past 100k around october or november of this year and that will be the time to move into altcoins for that final end of year pump. 

I currently have executed all of my trades and have accumulated my positions so that when I exit toward the end of the year with the plan to rebuy during capitulation 9-12 months later I will have only long term capital gains to worry about. I have nothing but words of disgust for what Janet Yellen and Bidens administration is proposing for unrealized gains, but that is a topic for another day.

Here is where I get to the point of my post: I am torn between long term capital gains and trading this year. If we look at coins like xrp and xlm and how they performed in 2017, it would have been possible to turn 1 btc into 100 with two properly executed trades. If history repeats itself, which it tends to: it may be a good idea to get 100% into BTC by June 2021 and then 80% into alts by Oct 2021. This could be a lifechanging amount by just trading the alt seasons and stacking sats. 

I genuinely believe multi-millionaires will be made this year and they will be made trading the speculative mania on BTC and ETH value spikes within altcoins. I have a friend who properly rode out the bear market and turned 1k into 10 million in just a few years selling pumps. I expect him to be at 100M end of this year. This is truly the year where we need to put friends, family, and loved ones on the backburner because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity we have at our fingertips. I am glad I lost the unrealized gains I did in 2017 because it taught me a valuable lesson. Watching BTC perform also taught me that the patterns are still in tact. 

We are still so early and I hope we all make it. Just remember that at the end of every executed trade there is a winner and a loser. Also remember that if you are buying at ATH in sats, you will likely be the loser.

I wish everyone a prosperous 2021 and here's to hoping we never have to wage slave a day after 2022. This could be the year for many of us, but we just have to put in the work. You can not hodl and get rich in a single cycle. You have to be diligent and trade the swings. You have to check your portfolio every 5 (or at least 30) minutes. Set limit orders on your trusted exchanges. Be smart about your actions. Do not get emotionally attached. If your favorite altcoin is at ATH in sats, sell most of it and buy later. We have a proven long term history that this strategy works, but people get too emotionally attached.

Lets do this.",2021-01-23 03:21:01

circumvent the current financial system and undermine American interests. For example, the
Central Bank of China just issued its first digital currency.

Dr. Yellen, what do you view as the potential threats and benefits these innovations and
technologies will have on U.S. national security? Do you think more needs to be done to ensure
we have appropriate safeguards and regulations for digital and cryptocurrencies in place?


Answer: I think it important we consider the benefits of cryptocurrencies and other digital
assets, and the potential they have to improve the efficiency of the financial system. At the
same time, we know they can be used to finance terrorism, facilitate money laundering, and
support malign activities that threaten U.S. national security interests and the integrity of
the U.S. and international financial systems. I think we need to look closely at how to
encourage their use for legitimate activities while curtailing their use for malign and illegal
activities. If confirmed, I intend to work closely with the Federal Reserve Board and the
other federal banking and securities regulators on how to implement an effective regulatory
framework for these and other fintech innovations.

The Tether Problem: A Quantitative Analysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l2f631/the_tether_problem_a_quantitative_analysis/,44,CryptoCurrency,24,"**Warning: this is not a short post.**  

TL;DR The price of Bitcoin is likely to fall *at least* 15%, and as much as 75%, ***if*** it turns out that Tether has been improperly minting Tethers that are not backed 1:1 by USD. Again, IF.  

**Intro**  

As I‚Äôm sure everyone is aware by now, Tether has been in a multi-year legal battle over its legitimacy. However, there seems to be a lot of disagreement about the potential consequences of Tether folding, so I decided to do some analysis. Please know that this analysis is not infallible, as it makes many assumptions and is based on an economic concept that may not translate directly to the crypto market. It is simply an attempt to gauge the potential impact of Tether imploding.    

**Method and Analysis**  
The analysis is based on the premise that the velocity of money, or how many times a dollar circulates through the market, has a direct impact on the nominal price level of transactions. The velocity of money, V, is defined as 

    V = PT/M  

Where

    P = nominal price level
    T = aggregate real value of transactions in a given time frame
    M = money supply

The wiki page on velocity of money offers a good description: [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_money)

In our case, however, we already know how many times each dollar is spent in the Bitcoin market, defined here as the market cap of Bitcoin. It is simply the annualized 24-hour volume of bitcoin transactions divided by the market cap. To do this, I used CoinGecko. In fact, I also used the Wayback Machine at https://archive.org/web/ to pull data from every six months or so (depending on availability) going back to November 2018. It appears CoinGecko lumps Bitcoin transactions other than spot in with total Bitcoin volume, so I calculated velocities for both stated (all) and specified (spot only) transactions. Here are the results for [velocity calculations.]( https://imgur.com/WtHzTkj)

For the sake of this analysis, I will only talk about the specified volume as we're only interested in spot transactions. As you can see, July 2019 is a bit of an outlier in terms of Tether volume, but overall the numbers are remarkably steady over more than two years. This has been accompanied by a slow but steady decrease in velocity, which makes sense as more and more bitcoin are held rather than actively traded or spent. What we will focus on is the fact that in general, more than half of all bitcoin trade volume is conducted in Tether. That is the root of the problem.   

Going back to our formula now, we can assume that T ‚Äì the real value of transactions ‚Äì can be held constant regardless of the other variables. Doing so, and moving things around a bit, we get   

    P = VM    

And consequently, the change in P is equal to the change in V*M. Now, we need to make some assumption about the supply of money in the Bitcoin market, to which Tether adds about $25b at the time of writing ($24b just a week ago when I grabbed all my data). I have made the simple assumption of one trillion dollars. I will show you that this is a relatively conservative estimate in regard to the question at hand, regardless of the actual value, but for now just go with it. From here, we can calculate the total multiplier impact of Tether on the price of Bitcoin, by multiplying Tether‚Äôs velocity multiplier by its money supply multiplier. 

    V multiplier = 100%/45% = 2.22
    M multiplier = 1t/(1t - 25b) = 1.025
    P multiplier = 2.22 * 1.025 = 2.28  

And there we have it. Tether, primarily through vastly increased trading volume, has more than doubled the price of Bitcoin.   

But wait! This is totally fine as long as all Tethers are legitimate. If they were, then even if Tether itself didn‚Äôt exist, other stablecoins could have picked up the slack to meet trade demand and the market would look the same today. It only becomes a problem if it turns out that money flowing into Bitcoin, and cycling through the market more than 11 times this year, is fraudulent money. So, what do we do? We calculate the V*M multiplier effect on P in scenarios in which less than 100% of Tether is legitimate. Then, we can compare the resulting multiplier to the base case multiplier and see how much lower the price would be. Here is a [sample](https://imgur.com/fCR0xHP) of how that is done.

Now, which scenarios are realistic? I‚Äôm sure many of you have read that Tether‚Äôs lawyer stated in April of 2019 that Tether was only about 74% backed by cash equivalents [(source)]( https://www.coindesk.com/tether-lawyer-confirms-stablecoin-74-percent-backed-by-cash-and-equivalents). That was when there were only 2.8b tethers in circulation! That number has increased nearly 10x in less than two years(!!), and it seems Tether‚Äôs printing has only ramped up over that time, as reflected in [Tether‚Äôs market cap.](https://imgur.com/xl0Uth8) As such, I doubt Tether is any more than 74% backed currently, and I personally believe it‚Äôs much less than that. So, let‚Äôs take a look a few different scenarios of Tether backing, which we interpret in the model as the amount of legitimate Tether‚Äôs and the amount of trade conducted in fully backed Tether: [initial analysis]( https://imgur.com/Y8MWrZU)  

As you can see, increasing the money supply above $1t has very limited impact on the estimated Bitcoin price reduction, whereas lower money supply assumptions start making Tether‚Äôs $25b contribution to supply more relevant. For reference, $20t money supply is the total US money supply in its broader interpretation (M2). Regardless, it‚Äôs very clear that the less Tether is truly backed by USD, the bigger the potential price drop.   

We‚Äôre not done yet though. In our current model, we assume that the 55/45 volume split applies to money flowing *into* Bitcoin. However, the 55% is Tether‚Äôs representation among *all* Bitcoin transactions. This includes pairs like ETH/BTC, LTC/BTC, DOT/BTC, and Bitcoin being sold for USDT. [This article]( https://crypto-anonymous-2021.medium.com/the-bit-short-inside-cryptos-doomsday-machine-f8dcf78a64d3) on the same topic, posted to Medium a week ago, estimates that the closer to 70% of all Bitcoin purchases are made in USDT. Let‚Äôs take another look at the same analysis if we start changing that assumption, holding market supply steady at $1t: [sensitivity analysis](https://imgur.com/1fEQBOo)  

  Clearly, this assumption has massive impact on the results. 

**So, what do I do?**  

That is the question. What we‚Äôve shown here is that, regardless of Bitcoin‚Äôs price, it is subject to drop significantly if it is revealed that Tether has been improperly minting Tethers that are not backed 1:1 by USD. However, it is not unimaginable that the market could collectively shrug off the news and recover quickly after a small drop. On the other hand, this would certainly be the biggest fraud in recent crypto history, which could shake out all confidence built up in the market since the 2017 bubble and bust. In such a scenario, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if prices fell below that maximum drop predicted here. It could also be the case that somehow, against all odds, Tether is actually fully 1:1 backed and will escape from its legal woes exonerated and unblemished. In short, there‚Äôs really no telling what the hell is going to happen, but any rational person should be wary of this situation. For what it‚Äôs worth, I spent the last week selling off about 20% of my portfolio, and plan to sell off progressively more as (and if) the market continues to bubble up.   

**Parting Thoughts**  

The [article](https://crypto-anonymous-2021.medium.com/the-bit-short-inside-cryptos-doomsday-machine-f8dcf78a64d3) referenced above is really worth a read. It‚Äôs what inspired me to undertake this project. One of the things the author points out is that you can‚Äôt trade USD for Tether very easily, and it‚Äôs common knowledge that redeeming USD from Tether (the company) is extremely difficult, to the point of being prohibitive. According to CoinGecko, USDT/USD made up less than 1% of Tether volume. This isn‚Äôt all that surprising on its own, but it gets a little weird when only one out of the top 10 Bitcoin exchanges has both USDT and USD trading [(see here)](https://imgur.com/iRg7zCk). Even more weird, that one exchange is Bitfinex, which is owned and managed by the same people as Tether. Bitfinex is the exchange that was accused of manipulating Bitcoin‚Äôs price in 2017, using Tether. Spooky stuff.   

As I mentioned, my analysis is not infallible. Any criticisms or follow-ons are welcome. [Here]( https://easyupload.io/aabr40) is a link to the Excel file containing all data and analysis.",2021-01-22 17:07:51

This could be for anything from a link to a news article, or a reposted meme. Now, there's nothing wrong with that. People can upvote what they want, it's how reddit works. But for Moon distribution, I would like to propose that all posts are limited to 1000 karma.

This would allow a more even distribution of Moons across the sub.

It is also arguably a fairer distribution. Currently, one person may receive a disproportionately large amount of Moons for something as simple as sharing a CoinTelegraph article, while many others, who may be active members of the sub, offering helpful advice and support to others, will receive a fraction of the amount of Moons in comparison.

1000 karma worth of Moons for posting a meme or sharing an article is still a huge amount in comparison to the amount you get for offering helpful advice in the comment section, so it's not like top posts won't be incentivized, it will just allow a fairer distribution.

Limiting all posts to a maximum of 1000 karma would still enable popular posts to be rewarded generously, while allowing a greater share of the Moons to be distributed amongst other users.

Tether: The False Dichotomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l301tk/tether_the_false_dichotomy/,1,CryptoCurrency,1,"Seems people tend to fall into a false dichotomy regarding Tether. Either it's a total scam 100% responsible for pumping the fake markets, who's eventual downfall will permanently destroy the entire crypto market ... or ... Tether has absolutely no effect on the market, and anyone who says otherwise is a Satoshi hating, tabloid reading, crypto conspiracy theorist.

I think it's possible to take a more balanced approach. While it's certainly true that large investments by particular corporate entities, along with retail, are driving a significant amount of demand into crypto, in anticipation of the latest cycle. At the same time, it's also probably true Tether is printing USDT that wasn't driven by market demand, but by their intention to acquire crypto essentially for free. iFinex is a shady ass company that has repeatedly lied, misrepresented, and attempted to operate as opaque as possible. 

They are probably a not-insignificant factor in how hard and fast this market has pumped, but certainly not the only factor. It's possible that their fraud was so profitable, that they actually will be (or already are) fully backed. The current investigation is limited in scope; however, this is the first time they have actually submitted documents to a regulatory agency, and we could easily see further litigation against them, and in broader scope.

If this were to occur, it would take some time to progress, as the legal system can be quite slow, and Tether has shown itself resourceful at delaying proceedings. If their fraud is revealed and proven in court, and they are forced to cease and desist, and even prosecuted, that doesn't mean that crypto will be destroyed. It will probably cause signficant price volatility, and we could be eventually looking at another regular ole bear market, regardless of Tether.

It's reasonable to suspect that some of the massive spikes in many of the altocoins (2-4x in the span of a week, starting in summer of last year), could be related to this Tether printing, which began in earnest March of last year. It's likely that they have tested and developed various mechanisms to keep this hidden, maintain the peg, and likely covertly partnered or have cooperating exchanges and corporate entities which help perpetuate this fraud, albeit while attempting to maintain some form of plausible deniability.

Overall, I don't see this as healthy for confidence in the markets. I would rather see reasoable consistent BTC price increases like we had in 2016 and the first half of 2017, and a longer, more stable bull market. If Tether is currently contributing to exponential price rises, sure we could see insane valuations, and I'm not going to complain about gettin those madgainz. But I want to keep a small does or reality, knowing that it's possible that some of this is Tether related, although not all of it, and that it contributes to the likelyhood of both higher prices than we would otherwise reach from honest, organic adoption, and that it could lead to also sharp declines, if/when we reach a blowoff top.

I'm not calling for any particular price targets or timeline based on this. Just pointing out that it's a relevant factor to consider, when analyzing these markets.",2021-01-23 13:04:39

Newbies to crypto: Long term gains are your friend.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l2gedw/newbies_to_crypto_long_term_gains_are_your_friend/,30,CryptoCurrency,21,"If you are new to crypto/investing and have bought crypto in the past few months you don't really want bitcoin to moon to 100k now.

Then, if you want to sell and take profit you get to keep a lot more of it.

If you are interested in other coins, add them into a dollar-cost average strategy instead of selling your existing coins and losing that buy date.

For me, having a bit more of a strategy around financial goals and tax implications helps me feel less impulsive during these drops. Corrections and drops are fine because I can't even sell some of my coins until end of the year and a drop pushes the peaks a bit down the road. Sadly, I am too impulsive and reactive to be able to just say HODL and that be enough to stop me from selling.

If this sounds crazy, keep in mind that historically, the most consistently profitable investment that any idiot can make in stocks is just buying the S&P or NASDAQ, which is essentially this but with company stocks. 

This makes sense with what my experience has been, I originally thought the idea of just sticking with Blue Chips was the way to go but as I started giving into my collector's itch to try to own a bag of everything, I noticed that my gains were way more consistent, and far less susceptible to bear times, plus catching you get to catch pieces of those inevitable 10-50xes that we all live for, albeit a small piece. Plus it's lower risk. Yes most will go to zero, but some of them will 100-1000x, and nobody fucking knows if today's Bluechip are going to be around in ten years, this industry is changing so quickly, that 10mil cap altbag that has been crabbing for 4 years could be the standard in 10.

"From the Creators of coinfeeds-bot -- about who we are, and moons",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l2cgld/from_the_creators_of_coinfeedsbot_about_who_we/,43,CryptoCurrency,24,"Dear Community,

Hello, this is a message from the creators of the coinfeeds-bot. Yes, we are human beings. We have been posting on the crypto subs for over a month now, and us, the creators, have never commented as humans, although we read all of your comments and posts. **There seems to be quite a stir over these moon distributions, so we thought we would clear the air.**

First an intro -- we are two people who have been working on machine learning and NLP (natural language processing) for many years. **We created Coinfeeds as a collection of projects to apply machine learning to crypto markets, and the coinfeeds-bot is one of our creations.** It's not all that we do actually, and we are working on more things to apply natural language processing and machine learning to crypto text.

**We definitely did not create coinfeeds-bot to ""farm moons"" -- it is not worth it.** Coinfeeds-bot runs a deep neural network that took us a long time to fine-tune so that it works well with crypto news. It is not something that was built overnight based on some open-sourced library. It also needs an expensive GPU to run -- it current costs us $3000 a month to run the bot. It is not worth writing summaries for moons -- either for humans or for machines!

*::edit::*

*We can run the bot for as long as we have access to GPUs -- it costs more than any moon can pay for, and it will not last forever.*

*If you have any more questions you can ask here and we will address.*

*::edit::*

We run on many subreddits, r/Cryptocurrency being one of them. Seeing people's upvotes and positive comments is encouraging to us. **When a community is supportive, it is very wholesome to see as builders -- it encourages us to keep building.** But when the community that we are contributing to bands together to exclude us -- when a poll that calls us out by name to exclude us can get hundreds of upvotes, that's pretty discouraging. **Ouch!**

But we are going to use our heads here, and we know that more people like us than dislike us, because there are many positive comments, and most of all -- the karma speak for itself. Karma is based on both upvotes and downvotes, so if people didn't like us, we would not have gotten so much karma. **So the fact that we have a lot of positive karma means that many people like us. The ones who are unhappy because of the moons are loud, but they are few.**

We do believe that we contribute value. And we do work pretty hard! **Just because summaries are autogenerated doesn't mean that we are not training it, maintaining it, and updating it behind the scenes.** So if moons are meant to incentivize good contributions, we do believe that we deserve them. This community clearly cares a lot about moons. If it is not willing to give out what it values, then what does that say about the service we are contributing? It is clearly not valued enough.

But hey, it was never about the moons. Moons is a new system and it doesn't seem to be perfect. People who have a lot of moons are voting to exclude us from moon distribution. **If the vote goes through, we don't think it would be fair, but we would accept it.**

**To anyone who did like us, upvoted us, or commented ""good bot"" to us, thank you, it means a lot. We're sure that there are more of you out there than those who are unhappy because of the moons.**

Now think about Bitcoin. Let‚Äôs say you bought the old ATH around 20k. You would just have to hodl around 4yrs to double that investment. Therefore, even if you had the worst timing in the past you would still produce a better return better than can be expected with stock market indices.

Most of my portfolio is saved onto a Ledger, but their were a # of alts I could not put onto said Ledger, and thus stayed with my Binance account. (I know... not your keys not your coins!)

What I did NOT realize is the limited crypto's on Binance US (52 currently) and thus a # of alts I hold cannot be transferred. 

My question is can I trade those to USD and then transfer that to Binance US wallet? I honestly don't even know if it will allow me to do the USD trade. The alternative is keeping those on Binance for now and seeing if they become available on US. 

Any help is appreciated!",2021-01-23 08:34:05

Curb your ignorance before you take a dump on my Moons,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l2lc58/curb_your_ignorance_before_you_take_a_dump_on_my/,4,CryptoCurrency,19,"When a billionaire donates 2 million to charity are you the guy that says ""Donating 0.001% of their networth! Fking scammers!"" ? If yes then bear with me for a minute because you are yelling at the wrong people.

#**Moons are a scam and we don't need them**


Reddit has been very specific about the token value. Currently, as far as they are concerned, Moons have none. It is us, the degen gamblers that gave them value because we really love to speculate. Moons are on testnet and Reddit cold announces at any moment that they won't be moving forward with them. Heck, they can even reset our values and make us start from scratch until Moons go on Mainnet and become actually tradable.

Decentralized governance **requires** decentralized ownership. If Reddit controls your voting rights (in this case the number of moons you accumulated over time) they can make them obsolete whenever they want. What is the point of decentralized governance if one entity controls all voting rights? You need an ERC-20 shitcoin to prove your voting rights and ownership of those same rights.


#**Incentivized interactions facilitate toxicity**

Really? Do you not have the right to downvote toxic content? Are you using that right or only taking a shit on it because others with the same right aren't using it the way you would want them to? We are angry at people for upvoting bullshit even though they still have no idea what they got into. They saw the news and bought Bitcoin. Price goes up, meme agrees with sentiment, newbie upvotes. We were all that guy at some point... When quality content becomes desirable by the MAJORITY of the community it will become a standard. You can't expect new members to show interest in quantum computing when they didn't even grasp the concept of Reddit yet.


#**Moons are actually a big deal**

Reddit is in the top 10 most visited websites in the world for a few years now. They are generating a lot of revenue from our shitposts. The same goes for all websites that generate social activity. Isn't it a bit unfair that you give them content for free and they take all of the money? IF community points prove to be a useful tool for a more fair revenue distribution everyone will have to implement it. Google owes you a lot of money. Reddit is actually giving a shit so maybe give them a chance. They really didn't have to.

Hash rate is not a good way to measure and compare the level of security provided by PoW. What matters is the total aggregated cost of mining of each network.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l2skdh/hash_rate_is_not_a_good_way_to_measure_and/,0,CryptoCurrency,6,"This is yet another huge false narrative in the crypto space that needs to be debunked. PoW works as a resource intensive activity. Its security is a function of the aggregated cost of mining equipment depreciation and operation.  This is why hash rate is a not a good security metric.  PoW's security is measured by the total cost of mining, not hash rates.

This results in two main implications:

* It is impossible to compare BTC's with ETH's security level by looking at hash rate alone because each uses a different hash function with dramatically different costs.
* Mining hardware becomes more efficient and cheaper over time, this means that the hash rate of a network must go up in order to maintain the same level of security over time.

EDIT:  This is exactly how the cost of a 51% attack is calculated.

Cost of a 51% attack = 51% of total aggregated cost (mining hardware deprecation + electricity) \* number of blocks needed to sustain the attack \* time per block",2021-01-23 07:03:07

Read about the backgrounds of the project leaders/developers of whatever you are interested in.  Read about projects you missed out on.  Read about running your own node.  Read about staking.  Read about DeFi.  Read about smart contracts.  Read about projects that failed.  Read about traditional (fiat) currencies.  Read about the gold standard.  Read about silver, platinum, and other precious metals.  Read about gemstones.  Read about the history of money.  Even if you don't think it'll interest you much, learn about it.

Listen to/watch YouTube videos.  Listen to podcasts.  Listen to your friends and family.  If they say negative things, listen.  If they say positive things, listen to those also.

Honestly, I think there was Foul Play. Something doesn't feel right about the timing of the SEC's action. Not to mention the UK stated XRP is not a security, same with Japan, where XRP is apparently pretty popular.

My feeling is that there was an attempt to stop Ripple in its tracks as it was gathering a huge amount of momentum and became a threat. Possibly pressure from the banking lobbies? Competitors? Maybe bankers felt Ripple was acquiring too much power and something needed to be done quickly? Who knows.

All of it is fishy as hell - and while people think Ripple is done for good I think it would be a good idea to allocate 5%-10% of my stash to XRP.

At some point, some started noticing that Ethereum was an objectively better technology; not in a trivial sense like ""it has faster transactions"", but in a fundamental level: Bitcoin's inability to execute computer programs made it incapable of settling non-trivial monetary exchanges in a decentralized way, resulting in an ecossystem that was nothing but a constellation of centralized services on top of a decentralized balance tracker. This realization caused many to speculate that Ethereum would eventually overcome Bitcoin, at least under the assumption that the market would seek a fully decentralized economy, and not just a big fat decentralized store of value. Of course, this belief was speculative, but it was a strong enough case to cause Ethereum to almost surpass Bitcoin back then. Fast forward a few years, Ethereum is now sitting at a boring 11% of Bitcoin's market cap with no signs of revival. 

**My question is: what changed?** Is the market betting that people won't care about decentralized economics and that a decentralized store of value will be enough? Is the Ethereum network losing its momentum or is it inferior in any sense? Are there competitors to Ethereum itself with a huge potential of overcoming it? Is 11% of Bitcoin's market cap a fair price for the only alternative currency with a non-negligible potential of overcoming it?",2021-01-22 06:02:28

First of all I know asking for financial advice in the crypto universe is not always applauded. However, this community has always helped me learn more. With that off the way, here is a brief explanation of my situation / issue:

I joined the crypto universe about two years ago and since then I only used one exchange/wallet and few well-known decentralized wallets as well. I liked this exchange even though everyone was giving negative feedback about most of the time. Recently they began to exhibit an exit scam behaviour, at first I thought it was only me then I started to check the reviews and discus it with other users and my doubts grew. Their support team is shallow and passive aggressive and now I fear for my crypto savings that are there!

Long story short, I want to move my funds out of there to a secure wallet I own the keys to as soon as possible but my issue is with the network fees (they claim to not charge any fees from their side). I have what is worth of 18 US dollars of Bitcoin now and it is my first and only BTC I ever owned so it holds value to me. If I transfer it the network fee will cost me ~ 9 dollars... and the other coin is 20 dollars worth of ETH and the network fee will cost me about 8 bucks or so.

What should I do? transfer my coins and lose almost half my holdings to network fees or leave them in this sketchy wallet that used to be reliable and risk losing everything one morning?

It seems to me that coinbase is no longer a trustworthy platform, and won't be until they hire a customer support staff. There is even talk of a class-action lawsuit. This post is to get the attention of coinbase 'support' and to spread the word about this disastrous company. I can't believe all of this, especially pre-IPO.",2021-01-22 08:32:23

Bob loukas' analysis nailed the bottom of the bear market of late 2018/early 2019...

He studied the previous 4 yr cycles/halvings, and specifically nailed the start of the next 4 yr cycle of 2019.

If you watched this and followed his analysis you would have entered bitcoin at less than 4k/btc.

You would have accumulated all of 2019 and 2020.

He advises buy dips, of 2019/20....

He talks about selling as the bull run moves in year three (2021)of the cycle.... Selling portions of your position as it climbs up...

He advises having an exit strategy or price points as it climbs...

Though he is bullish on btc in this current cycle, he does not want to make absolute price positions...

But he does see this bull cycle topping in between 100k and 250k....

Most importantly to me is the bear market that is in the final year of the 4yr cycle...

In the bear market the previous retracements have been 70-80%....

I followed this advice from March of 2019... When I was homeless, with little extra fiat to invest.

The next cycle I will be more prepared.

Is this an absolute in bitcoin.... No.

Does he make a reasonable proven example... Yes.

Some people believe there is not a 4yr cycle, but instead a set of lengthening cycles... Is this true? Who knows? Only years more of btc will prove it.

Watch all of bobs videos, and he will tell you his position.... That he added to it in March 20, and how he plans his exit plan...

Is he a god, a guru, a perfect analyst.... No.

But he did nail the bottom/start of the 4 yr cycle... And if you would have followed his advice you would be holding btc at buy ins of 4k...up... And in positive territory with returns of 200%(8k), 400%(16k), and 800%(at 32k).

Please study this, it may change your life, or your investment strategy.

Best wishes....blessings to all.

Thank you bob loukas... You helped change my life.",2021-01-22 09:57:57

But I‚Äôd love to buy Bitcoin at this dip right now. I‚Äôll be getting a large check in about 3-4 weeks. By then, I‚Äôm sure Bitcoin will be at an ATH. So got me thinking, what if I purchase using leverage now and payoff when I receive the check. I‚Äôve never traded using margin and leverage before so I was hoping somebody can eli5 for me. 

I have a Kraken account and see that they offer 5x on Bitcoin. Let‚Äôs say I currently have 1 bitcoin (I wish) and I use that as my margin. Would I then be able to open a long position of 5 bitcoins at the current price? So let‚Äôs say I opened with 5 bitcoins at $30k and I close my position in 4 weeks at $50k. How do I close the position? Do I have to deposit $150k to pay off the 5 bitcoins bought at $30k and keep the 5 bitcoins? Or do I just close the position and receive the 2 Bitcoin difference ($100k)? 

Again, not looking to be a day trader, just seeing if there‚Äôs a way I can buy bitcoins now during the dip and payoff at a later time. Thanks",2021-01-22 16:04:47
My little analogy for the ‚Äúdouble spend‚Äù situation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l2co7q/my_little_analogy_for_the_double_spend_situation/,4,CryptoCurrency,9,"No double spending occurred as you all know; a real world analogy I thought was appropriate would be like someone paying for something with a credit card, and then being allowed to walk away with the goods before the card reader says ‚Äúapproved‚Äù. 

If you did this to two separate people, it would seem like double spending. 

imagine a guy wants to buy two hot dogs, from two different hot dog stands, but he only has enough money on his card for one. 

He walks up to the first hot dog stand and he swipes his card, the salesman hands him the hot dog and then he sprints over to the other hot dog vendor, swipes his card and grabs the hotdog and runs off, ALL BEFORE EITHER CREDIT CARD READER SAID ‚Äúapproved‚Äù 

Now in reality, only one transaction will go through; the first one. It will say approved, but the second one, since the money is gone now, will say ‚Äúdeclined‚Äù and the second hot dog vendor will be watching the guy run away with his unpaid for hot dog. 

as far as the credit card goes, no double spending occurred - only one transaction was approved and the money went to the correct, ‚Äòfirst‚Äô transaction.  But in reality, the effects of a double spend did occur, but it was human error for allowing the goods to be taken away before the transaction was approved, it had nothing to do with the fault of the network.

"Canadian Tax Foundation ""Positive Aspects of Anonymity""",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l27nxi/canadian_tax_foundation_positive_aspects_of/,12,CryptoCurrency,3," 

As I was looking through a [paper](https://farris.com/content/uploads/2019/04/20180924-Taxation_of_the_Token_Economy.pdf) released a few years ago titled:  ""*TAXATION OF THE TOKEN ECONOMY: CRYPTOCURRENCY AND DLT TOKENS*""  I noticed that there was actually a section within the paper that  explained the benefits of anonymity in crypto as well as the benefits of  being able to send a viewkey to people who are relying on trust in the  accurate reporting of your balance. Obviously this was right next to the  typical sections of ""Anti Money Laundering"" and ""Anti Terrorist  Financing"" This is an excerpt:

&#x200B;

>Despite   the  negative  associations  often  made  regarding  the  anonymity   of  tokens,  there  are  in  fact  many  positive aspects as well.93   The anonymity can protect individuals from criminals by hiding a  person‚Äôs wealth, or  protecting  confidential  personal  transactions   such  as  purchases  of  medical  goods  or  services.94    Using  traditional payment systems, people are required to reveal their  identity to a central party and trust that central party to protect  their privacy ‚Äì   which central trusted party often fails to maintain  that privacy.  In the age of digital hacking, the breach of trusted  third-party secure information is only increasing.  Tokens accelerate  the potential of digital payment systems, while maintaining the privacy  of cash transactions.

&#x200B;

As  a Canadian who has a business that deals exclusively in Monero, I have  been looking into the general sentiment of the Canadian gov for a few  years now regarding privacy enhancing cryptocurrencies and out of  everything I have read, from taxation guidelines, to the staff  discussion papers released by the Bank of Canada, I have noticed that  the people at the top at least recognize the benefits of a  privacy-enhancing cryptocurrency.",2021-01-22 10:30:46

Hi,

Thanks for your data deletion request. We have taken appropriate steps to ensure the erasure of your personal data associated with the information you provided from our systems and relevant third-party providers.

**Note that some of your personal data may be further retained** by Ledger in order to comply with applicable data retention laws and other legal requirements (eg. tax and accounting requirements, fraud prevention).

Please rest assured that the protection of your personal data is of paramount importance for Ledger. Thank you for your patience and support as we continue building products and internal policies that respect your privacy.

Kind regards,  


The Ledger Privacy Team¬†  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


I have two observations.   


1. Ledger has third-party 'providers' with whom they share customers' personal information. The scope and specificity of these providers is seemingly intentionally vague, and it raises yet more privacy-related questions than it answers. I remember thoroughly reading the T/C disclaimer before making my wallet purchase from Ledger, and nowhere did I see any mention of this.   

2. Lawfully enforced tax, accounting, and fraud prevention requirements seem like all the reasons Ledger needs to effectively do nothing with the personal data it stores. I am quite put off with this CYA clause, and it just makes me more disappointed that I chose to do business with Ledger in the first place. 

&#x200B;

I'm one of 20,000 or so people who was directly contacted by blackmailers in an attempt to obtain my seed words. Since that's happened, I've transferred my crypto to another platform entirely before wholly abandoning Ledger as an offline crypto custodian solution, and I suggest you do the same.

Many of you already know, but I also believe that the bull run brought many new people. So I would like the new ones to see this and understand that the markets need this type of movement in the short term.

Well, for the new ones who bought in 40k, there is still a chance, don't despair. These 10% - 20% or 30% pullbacks are normal in a market that has as little liquidity like this one. Now, there is also another scenario that is that the price ""breaks"" the 23k downwards, in that case the story would be different and it would be a good time to exit the market (unless you plan to hold, therefore you do not want to sell practically never, and in most cases this can be a good strategy).

Looks like GBTC premium is down to 0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l26toi/looks_like_gbtc_premium_is_down_to_0/,7,CryptoCurrency,19,"I am an investment advisor and I invest in GBTC for clients who want exposure to BTC in a retirement account. I follow the premium or discount that GBTC trades at compared to BTC pretty closely.

To those unaware, each share of GBTC is supposed to be worth 0.001 BTC, so if BTC is $40,000, GBTC should be $40/share. When GBTC trades above that, say at $48/share, there is a $8/share premium or (8/40) 20% premium. 

Investors are sometimes willing to pay the premium for the convenience of buying GBTC, which can be easily traded in any investment account, in lieu of buying actual BTC on an exchange and storing it themselves. 

This last week the premium has gone from about 20% down to 0% this morning. It was actually trading at a slight discount for a few minutes. I wanted to get people‚Äôs thoughts on why that happened.

I did notice that a new way to invest in BTC is becoming available for accredited investors (professionals who can buy unregistered securities) OBTC, from Osprey. The expense ratio on OBTC is only 0.49%, while GBTC is 2.0%. However, investing in OBTC requires a 25k minimum investment and shares are locked from trading for 1 year.

I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm just curious as to what people think is happening here. It‚Äôs possible that some big institutional investors are dumping GBTC and waiting for OBTC to become available, so this little dip we‚Äôve had the last two days may be corrected once OBTC becomes available and institutions jump into that.",2021-01-22 09:50:54

Proposal to decrease MOON distribution for link posts,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l1rod9/proposal_to_decrease_moon_distribution_for_link/,96,CryptoCurrency,27,"You've seen the ""Bitcoin did X"" or ""Ethereum did Y"" posts racking up thousands of upvotes in the front page. The first of content like these to be posted are the ones to hit the spotlight. It's actually a race. A race considering the vast disparities of internet connection, reaction time, computer speed, etc.

The intended purpose of this sub is to communicate with members who are interested in cryptocurrency, not game the system to earn moons whenever important news comes out. Moons are supposed to be a fun way to represent ownership of this sub, to be rewarded for meaningful contribution. A news article goes a long way for communication, but you didn't write it. People just post it and be rewarded for someone's work. It takes no forethought to copy a link the moment the notification bell rings and paste it here.

I've seen many proposals to reduce moon distribution for meme/comedy posts. I've seen quite a few for media posts, but I want to give it a stronger argument for this proposal, and bring it to light. It surprises me that this hasn't been proposed as much as for meme posts, as most are images taken off of the internet; they are the same caliber of low-effort. Posting useful information shouldn't turn into a race to get moons.

**EDIT. jwinterm requests karma reduction statistics.**

I would see a 4x decrease in moons awarded to link post karma optimal.

The Billionaires and Private Banksters start educating themselves about Crypto. This is not a wild guess but based on observations I made in the UHNWI industry.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l1w8e1/the_billionaires_and_private_banksters_start/,37,CryptoCurrency,29,"Yes I know, we all do know the stories about big Whales getting bigger, or about [MicroStrategy investing 1 Billion in Bitcoin](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/company/company-videos/microstrategy-announces-over-1b-in-total-bitcoin-purchases-in-2020), or institutional players such as [Hedge Funds investing heavily in Crypto](https://www.trustnodes.com/2021/01/04/hedge-fund-buys-1-billion-bitcoin).

So this little post here is not about them. This post is about the really (add 3x really here) rich private investors, the guys you normally don‚Äôt read about because they don‚Äôt even want you to know that their families are among the richtest families on this planet. Those guys won‚Äòt tweet tweets like ‚ÄûI just bought 10.000 BTC and I plan to buy another 10.000 tomorrow! Let‚Äòs moon!‚Äú No, they definitely won‚Äòt do that.

However, I am working close to the Private Banking industry and my professional network (e.g Linkedin) also consists of several Private Bankers and Family offices Managers who take care of the money of the richest of the richest (the ultra high net worth individuals aka UHNWI).

So in my Linkedin network, I can see that lots of those financial advisors (some of them are Managing directors of the biggest Private banks worldwide) are actively participating in Crypto events as well as Crypto education sessions. And those education events are not organized and held by random 19yr old YouTuber, but (among others ofc) by the **[The Billionaire Chronicle (TBC)](https://billionairechronicle.com)**. This club is pretty private so I couldn‚Äôt find any public link but [here is a screenshot of such Crypto education event TBC did](https://ibb.co/yXLHZhG) (source Linkedin, event took place in January 2021). I have seen tons of posts like this during the past weeks.

So the fact that the traditional private banker and family office asset managers are educating themselves in the field of cryptocurrency is a big and positive thing.

I am not saying that those super rich guys and families will invest in Cryptos today or tomorrow. But they are obviously talking to their financial advisor about it. And they are challenging them, they want knowhow and skills in crypto field, from their private bankers. If they like it or not, they have to educate themselves, and that can only be a good thing!",2021-01-22 00:23:34

But what happens if (and frankly, that‚Äôs a big if) BTC reaches new heights at which 1 Satoshi would be worth a considerable amount of money, say $10?

I know that people are gonna say that there are other factors showing that Bitcoin has failed as a currency and has become an asset analogous to gold and that other currencies would be more suitable for what I have in mind.

Understanding what makes a cryptocurrency valuable. I encourage you to try using a smart contract once. This thread is for new people.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l1ny1h/understanding_what_makes_a_cryptocurrency/,49,CryptoCurrency,49,"Everyone seems to be buying in to the narrative that bitcoin is ""digital gold"" or ""gold 2.0"". Even the big financial players are starting to buy in to this narrative as well - and there's nothing wrong with that either. After using a few smart contracts and listening to the Winklevoss twins refer to ETH as digital oil, I got the idea.              

As per the title of this thread I think everyone in this sub who is invested in multiple coins has an obligation to his or herself to explore what their favorite platform coin can do - regardless of whether its Ethereum, NEO, LoopRing, waves or any other platform token.              

The one platform coin that is at the forefront of all of this goes without saying - ETH. I started buying up at the beginning of 2020 because I saw double digit Eth as a ""steal"" back in march of ~~this year~~ 2020. Then as time went on I thought it would be a good idea to trade a few DeFi tokens - which I won't mention here. So I went to Uniswap to do this first and realized when I traded Ether for the DeFi tokens, I was using a smart contract. Then I tried staking my DeFi tokens and realized, ""Oh this is a smart contract too..."" And that's when it clicked for me, ""If this gains traction and if there is an enterprise-level use case for this, then a lot of jobs may become unnecessary.""

If Eth scalability becomes a reality, then this is going to be big.

**EDIT:** Back when I did the trade on uniswap and the DeFi staking thing, Ethereum gas fees were much much cheaper (this was summer 2020). These days you are likely to pay a 20 dollar fee at the least to make such a trade. In my own experience I usually just check with metamask to see how much the smart contract execution fee is. If I think it's too high, I just wait until later to make it happen. If Eth 1.5 hits this year, then the fees will become considerably cheaper while Eth 2.0 will make the fees nearly non-existent.",2021-01-21 15:06:44

The Emergence of Fan Tokens,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l1zj07/the_emergence_of_fan_tokens/,2,CryptoCurrency,7,"# What is a Fan Engagement Token: The Emergence of Fan Engagement Tokens in the Entertainment Industry with Blockchain

From digital identity to decentralized finance, nearly every industry has explored the many possibilities of blockchain. The entertainment industry is no exception. Filmmakers, video game designers, and augmented reality developers are always looking for the next big invention, especially to enhance the fan experience. The more satisfied the fan, the more the fan will engage with a platform and spend on a product.

How can fan engagement tokens on the blockchain drive engagement, and in turn, further drive distribution in the entertainment industry? That is the million-satoshi question.

**Here is an introduction on fan engagement tokens, including:**

* What are fan engagement tokens?
* Why is fan engagement so important?
* Which companies offer fan engagement tokens?

## What are Fan Engagement Tokens?

One of the most exciting innovations to have developed at the intersection between entertainment and technology is the emergence of fan engagement tokens. Fan tokens represent a new way for the entertainment industry to engage with fans and a new way for fans to take their entertainment experience to the next level.

A fan engagement token is a utility token that serves as a fan‚Äôs access pass to a new type of engagement with their favorite sports team or movie studio. A fan token gives fans access and influence on certain decisions made by the team or the studio, such as which players take the field, and what jerseys they wear, or which movies get made and what the character‚Äôs costumes look like.

Fan tokens also give fans the opportunity to compete for, and win, exciting exclusive rewards, and get special VIP access and treatment to a variety of events. This could include a meet-and-greet with a fan‚Äôs favorite player or actor, or even luxury box-seats at a game or VIP red-carpet access to a film‚Äôs premiere.

Another advantage to fan tokens is that it gives fans the opportunity to increase their rewards and influence by increasing the number of fan tokens they have. Many fan tokens offer a variety of exclusive tiered-rewards for fans holding a higher number of tokens. So the more fan tokens that a fan owns, the better the fan‚Äôs chances of getting more exclusive rewards and the greater the amount of clout the fan has regarding various fan-led decisions. Fans can continue to accumulate fan tokens until they attain the coveted level of access and influence that they are trying to achieve.

In addition to all of these functional benefits of ownership, there is another distinct advantage to owning fan tokens: the fan engagement tokens give access to exclusive memorabilia that may increase in value over time. As is the case with many collectible items in the real world, fan engagement tokens give fans exclusive access to rare and one-of-a-kind items that can be the envy of collectors and fans everywhere. Through fan engagement tokens, fans can exchange their tokens for memorabilia and experiences that would otherwise be very difficult to get.

## Why Fan Engagement is so Important

Fans make the entertainment industry. From sports to movies and everything in between. Fans fill seats, fans create buzz, and fans build communities. They buy the limited edition items from the set. They buy the game-used jerseys. Fans spawn entire subcultures around the things that they love, which is why fan engagement is so critical to the success of any fan-driven industry. Fans are the lifeblood of any type of channel within the entertainment industry. They are the consumers of any entertainment product, and they play a vital role in the success of that product.

With the movie industry, like we‚Äôve seen with Deadpool, fans can also make or break the success of a franchise!

Any sports team or movie studio can attest to the fact that fan engagement has evolved significantly over the past decade. Part of that is the correlation that has been found between fan engagement and fan consumption. Now, more and more entertainment organizations are taking note of this evolution and looking for more innovative ways to engage with their fans, driven by increased demand from fans for inclusion, influence and interaction.

## Fan Engagement Tokens in the Film Industry

A number of companies have seized the opportunity to create fan engagement tokens in order to capitalize on the unique type of fan engagement that this technology offers. In the world of movies, companies like Mogul are offering fan engagement tokens that give them creative influence on films and insider access to the film industry.

Mogul is a decentralized film financing platform that offers exclusive rewards that are unique to the film industry. Mogul‚Äôs fan engagement token is aptly called the **STARS token.** Throughout the entirety of Mogul‚Äôs community-building process, film fans are rewarded for their involvement in giving films the greenlight and supporting films from the script to the screen. The STARS token powers the Mogul platform, and gives both fans and screenwriters complete insider access to Hollywood and the world of filmmaking.

Mogul‚Äôs STARS tokens are redeemable for incredible bespoke rewards that most film fans would never have access to. These rewards include a number of things such as limited-edition or one-of-a-kind movie posters, [rare NFTs](https://medium.com/mogulproductions/non-fungible-tokens-and-crypto-a-major-opportunity-for-movie-memorabilia-cc82958aa09c), and actual props and set-used memorabilia from a film. With more STARS tokens come even more rewards, such as voting on which films get made, getting an ‚Äúexecutive producer‚Äù credit on a film, and even dinner with a famous director.

## Fan Tokens for Sports

In the world of sports, companies like Chiliz and Socios have created fan tokens around European football clubs like FC Barcelona and Juventus, and MMA leagues like the UFC. Chiliz, the cryptocurrency and blockchain which powers the Socios platform, is looking to offer fan engagement tokens focused on sports and esports, such as soccer and video games. Socios can give fans the ability to vote on various aspects of a football club‚Äôs governance. This can include decisions such as who the football club plays during ‚Äúfriendlies‚Äù and which players the football club should look to sign.

By offering these unique fan-engagement experiences, rewards and discounts through fan engagement tokens, companies like Mogul and Chiliz are hoping to increase both fan engagement and revenues. On top of that, it will allow fans to feel as though they are an important part of the team or studio, even if they can‚Äôt physically attend games or go to movie theaters.

## Conclusion

We are still in the early days of blockchain technology, and this is currently the dawn of fan tokens. The use case is strong, and the reception to fan engagement tokens has been greeted warmly by fans looking to take their interest and engagement to the next level. Fan tokens offer entertainment companies like sports teams and film studios a unique way to increase fan engagement in the off-season and between films and give these organizations the potential to increase both their fan base and their revenues.",2021-01-22 04:01:46

Articulation of why Tether is a fraud,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l2560h/articulation_of_why_tether_is_a_fraud/,1,CryptoCurrency,20,"With reference to this amazing article:

[The Bit Short: Inside Crypto‚Äôs Doomsday Machine](https://crypto-anonymous-2021.medium.com/the-bit-short-inside-cryptos-doomsday-machine-f8dcf78a64d3)

The details of why Tether is a scam and how it works have not been articulated clearly enough. 

The process:

\-Tether mints let's say $400 million USDT without any backing.

\-They are distributed to proxy accounts with opaque connections back to the company. This is the point where it becomes a scam. They are not loaning it out to a third party as happens in banks.

\-Tethers are used to buy crypto on non-USD exchanges, driving prices higher. Let's say bitcoin is bought at an average price of $10K.

\-Price appreciation triggers FOMO, momentum investors, rational investors who believe that this level of price appreciation is validation that institutions are buying in.

\-These investors crowd in, providing price support, and push prices even higher.

\-Meanwhile, Tether Ltd. (via their proxy trading accounts) transfers coin to USD exchanges and starts to liquidate coin for USD at a slow enough rate not to crash the price. Let's say they are selling at an average price of $11K.

\-Tether Ltd. started with $400M in printed USDT and ends up with $440M in USD. Maybe they HODL longer and sell at an even higher price, why not as long as they keep pumping up the price and crucially, as long as the market buys into the idea that the price appreciation must be proof of genuine demand for bitcoin.

\-So the scam is that they print phony USDT but end up with real USD which they then claim as ""backing"" for their Tethers, minus the huge amounts that are probably ending up in the personal accounts of the Tether principals.  

&#x200B;

Crucially, all of this depends on triggering demand for crypto such that the massive liquidation of coin for USD does not crash the market. The ability to do this has depended on promoting plausible narratives for the rapid run up in prices. One particularly effective and perhaps self-fulfilling idea is that institutions are buying into bitcoin (witness the high-profile cases like Microstrategy).

At this point though, the game is probably coming to an end. Tether has been overdoing it starting in September 2020, perhaps because of the NY OAG investigation. Now there is widespread awareness of the scheme and higher prices make it more difficult for USDT issuance to influence the price ($350 million, the amount minted a day ago buys less bitcoin at $35K than at $10K). The high prices also reduce demand for the asset, so there is less price support.

TLDR

Tether printing pushes up bitcoin prices, price appreciation provides a self-fulfilling narrative to support the existence of massive genuine demand (ie. institutions are buying in), meanwhile Tether Ltd. exits market with real USD.",2021-01-22 08:35:00

And I earn about $2.50 every 30 hours. Which IMHO, is pretty shit considering it also means I cant access any of the funds for 2 entire weeks after I end the stake. Meaning no selling, trading, tethering, taking profits, exiting, ect. Coin could go up or down 300% tomorrow and you're stuck holding it for days. And honestly the earnings just aren't that good, especially considering it's 10k worth of the coin. 

On paper 15% sounds amazing for literally doing nothing. But the reality is, interest means nothing if you aren't absolutely loaded. 15% of $100 or $1000 is basically nothing for an entire year of having no access to your funds. 

Idk it seems just as risky having your coins locked in a stake as anything else. Seems like it's only a smart option for heavy bag hodlers who can make at least double digits per day, and not ever need to worry about accessing their funds.",2021-01-22 08:19:47

Education is more important for crypto adoption now than ever. So...I made a thing!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l1alxa/education_is_more_important_for_crypto_adoption/,151,CryptoCurrency,34,"Crypto education is more important now than ever.  Lots of our family and friends still don't understand most of the common concepts of crypto - much less the advanced ones.  I still have family that think that Bitcoin is a scam.  I have friends that think it's just like the Beanie Babies.  Despite that, others are inquisitive.  They ask what Bitcoin is.  They want to know about blockchain and what ""hodl"" means.  No one was born with basic knowledge of cryptocurrencies - everyone needs a basic foundation before they can begin to understand the intricacies of how it all works.  They need an ELI5 for most of the concepts that we see as already being simple.  

So I created [Crypto Peanuts](https://www.cryptopeanuts.com/).  

It's a site that's focused on the simplest explanations for each concept, a variety of cryptocurrencies, and exchanges.  It addresses the most common questions about crypto (like whether it's a scam or imaginary play money), as well as how to actually use it.  The site is not intended to provide advanced knowledge about any of these concepts, but the hope is that it gets your family and friends to the point where they're ready for that.  

It's not perfect and it needs a lot of work, but I'm committed to making this as helpful as possible.

This dream came to life last month in the form of a [poll](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kjbqks/karma_bonus_for_special_members_reward_users_who/).  It received 85% approval, but only 2.8 million moon votes.

After some feedback, **I've lowered the bonuses and have upped the initial bonus to incentivize new users**:  Below is the adjusted proposal:

Contributing 1000 Moons or $5/month makes you a Special Member. Being a Special Member is a practical way to demonstrate that users:

* *are active*
* *are invested,*
* *and are willing to give back to the community that has provided so much value to them*.

**In short: support the sub, the sub supports you.**

There are six badges tied to length of commitment. To encourage user participation and investment into [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/), I propose an incremental monthly karma bonus system tied to the length of Special Membership:

* 6% karma bonus for ""New Supporter"" (Conch Shell icon)
* \+5% bonus for ""One Month Supporter"" (Cocoa Plant icon) for a total of 11% bonus
* \+4% bonus for ""Three Month Supporter"" (Pearl icon) for a total of 15% bonus

* \+2% bonus for ""Nine Month Supporter"" (Coin icon) for a total of 20% bonus
* \+1% bonus for ""1-Year Supporter"" (Cube Snowflake icon) for a total of 21% bonus

There are no badges past 1-year supporter, so we can jump off that bridge when we get to it.

I assume Venmo, or an equivalent, is or will be available in other countries.  Then you also have the real possibility that most of the more economically advanced countries and the European Union will develop there own Central Bank cryptocurrency.   So if I want to transfer money via blockchain I could use my local government crypto (Iets assume these transfers can be made fast and cheap. ) Not to mention the existence of stable coins whose fees are sure to come down with competition.  

Based on the above, what is the realistic long term outlook for cryptocurrencies as digital money and what support is there that the value of these currencies will increase enough to make them worthwhile investments?

A real world use case question for NFTs - legal documents,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l1vxac/a_real_world_use_case_question_for_nfts_legal/,3,CryptoCurrency,7,"Greetings sub

Smart contracts are now available on several chains and I am hoping that some of you will have suggestions of places to look for a proposal I'm doing at work.

I work in UK property law. We are using something called the Law of Property Act 1925 to sign deeds.

A deed is a type of contract that is incredibly formal. Unlike a regular written contract, which anyone can sign, a deed can be an unfair exchange or whatever and is absolutely required for any interest in real estate. It's also used in high value transactions.

The thing about deeds is that each party needs to sign with a witness present; or, in the case of a company (or partnership) signing, two directors/partners. There is also a procedure for a ""company stamp"" holder to sign, but let's not worry about that.

Property transactions on the commercial level generally need stacks of deeds signing, each in duplicate/triplicate or whatever. All that paperwork spends ages of expensive lawyer time to collate, scan into databases, and distribute. Oh, and when the building is mortgaged, you end up creating new deeds to assign (transfer ownership of) the old deeds to new owners.

If this isn't crying out for a crypto replacement, I don't know what is!

I'm planning to write a brief for my department on the opportunities available as I've seen that NFTs and smart contracts have evolved and my firm's knowledge of crypto extends to ""Huh? Is that like Bitcoin?"". I'm very aware though that I'm not a crypto genius, I'm just enthusiastic.

My question to you is:

What smart contract platforms do you know of that support NFTs (for the rights under the contract) and multi-participant signatures/ the ability for one party to have two signatories before the contract is signed?",2021-01-21 23:58:52

In defense of OMG Network's value proposition,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l21ahv/in_defense_of_omg_networks_value_proposition/,0,CryptoCurrency,1,"I think a few recent developments have convinced many that the OMG Network is an outdated technology and caused many to lose hope in the project, and I think that sentiment is unfair, given what it has to offer.

The developments that I'm referring to are the following:

First off: Rollups. The emergence of Rollups as the preferred scaling solution of Ethereum tech leadership has led to Plasma being deemed by many as an obsolete scaling solution.

For example, Vitalik Buterin's recent proposal to make Rollups the primary focus of ETH2 scaling, in his [A rollup-centric ethereum roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698) has been used to argue against OMG Network's Plasma technology.

Second: DeFi. The growing demand for gas from complex smart contracts in the Ethereum DeFi system has led many to conclude that OMG Network's MoreVP Plasma system, which is limited to simple token transfers, is not addressing a pressing market need.

Third: Adoption of OMG Network alternatives, and especially Rollup-based alternatives. It's suggestive of MoreVP Plasma in general, and OMG Network in particular, having lost their momentum.

Fourth: As composability has emerged as an increasingly important property of Ethereum's DeFi system, a chain with a limited range of functionality like MoreVP Plasma, is being seen by some as decreasingly valuable, as it can't host a wide range of mutually composable dApps.

My rebuttal:

Rollups:

Ethereum's leading protocol designer, Buterin, has indeed settled on Rollups as primary scaling solution being the best development plan for Ethereum, but has by no means disavowed the utility of Plasma chains. He's even defended Plasma chains [in the OMG Network subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/OMGnetwork/comments/kqvt0z/is_this_vitalik_saying_he_thinks_plasma_and_maybe/gi9xgg9/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):

>That comment was regarding ZK versus optimistic rollups, it was not trying to say ZK rollups are better than every other category out there. For payments and DEX plasma definitely has the advantage of even greater scale (and hence lower fees) than rollups.

DeFi:

Ethereum's limited block space has meant that high value applications, like DeFi, have increasingly dominated usage. But that doesn't mean that other applications, like simple value transfers, wouldn't see enormous demand at a lower cost point. As the saying goes, supply can create its own demand. When a commodity becomes less scarce and more affordable, new use-cases emerge for it.

There are many historical examples of this, like aluminum, which when it was a scarce resource, was only used to make jewelry and expensive utensils, but after methods for extracting pure aluminum from bauxite ore were discovered that made it abundant and affordable, found massive demand for use in everyday and mass-produced items like cans, cooking foil, automobiles and thousands of other products.

People may not be clamouring to do simple payments on Ethereum right now, when average transaction fees are >$5, but if an Ethereum child-chain that offered transactions at extremely low fees gained traction, it could become the go-to platform on which to do basic value transfer transactions.

Momentum of OMG Network competitors and composability:

I reiterate the previous point: right now Ethereum is dominated by DeFi applications, so naturally the current crop of major projects would look to scalability projects that can facilitate a wide range of complex smart contracts with maximum composability.

OMG Network can target an entirely new market, outside of DeFi: high volume applications dominated by simple payments and trades. And there's every reason to believe that there will be demand for this: there is somewhere on the order of 100,000 simple payments done in the global economy every second. There are probably far more trades, when you include HFT. An extremely scalable blockchain that can execute basic transactions could prove enormously useful and popular.

**OMG Network's strong points**:

* Polished / production-ready scalability solution, which took years of development to reach its current state. The fact that OMG Network's demo was the [best among the proposals to the Great Reddit Scaling Bake-off](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff#wiki_omg_network), according to /u/Basoosh, is testament to how far along OMG Network is compared to other L2 scaling options.
* Connext is making strides in developing an inter-L2 bridging solution, [Vector](https://medium.com/connext/vector-0-1-0-mainnet-release-9496ae52c422), to make transferring value between different L2s seamless, which will reduce the need for the entire Ethereum ecosystem to converge on one general purpose L2 solution, and make application-specific chains like OMG Network more viable. In a more integrated inter-chain economy where the cost of transferring value across L2s is minimal, MoreVP Plasma's weaknesses are less damaging to its utility, as users can easily switch to Rollups when they require a feature that MoreVP Plasma is not optimized to offer, and then effortlessly transfer back to a MoreVP Plasma chain when they need features that MoreVP Plasma is best suited to provide.

**What OMG Network needs:**

More integration with other L2s, through technologies like the aforementioned Vector cross-chain routing protocol. OMG Network becoming more integrated with complementary L2 scaling solutions will mitigate its weaknesses, and accentuate its strengths, by giving users a greater ability to use OMG Network for only the applications it's best suited for while maintaining access to L2s with different feature-sets.",2021-01-22 05:33:56

How do buy low and sell high when your base currency price is also fluctuating?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l1sguh/how_do_buy_low_and_sell_high_when_your_base/,4,CryptoCurrency,10,"I am just starting to learn about cryptocurrency trading and  am having trouble grasping something. Let's say you buy some bitcoin on coinbase and transfer it over to binance to do day trading. You buy ripple at .30 each. Now you have 100 ripple. Later u see that ripple went up to .4 so you sell your 100 ripple making you in theory $10. But when you sell your ripple, you are really just converting that back to bitcoin right? Which isn't a stable price and could have gone up or down. For this example, it went down and you thought you made $10 but in actuality, you lost money since u started with more btc than you ended with.

So how do you day trade crypto knowing that there isn't a defined currency to base your gains on? I'm not sure if I am asking this correctly so let me try it in a non crypto way. 

If I have $100 and I buy 100 candy cars for $1 each then I sell those candy bars to someone for $2 each, know have $200 and made $100. Usd is defined and doesn't fluctuate so I definitely made the $100.  This is not how crypto trading is, correct? 

This would make a lot more sense to me if I could buy crypto from usd and sell to usd. Then in my wallets, I know exactly how much I have because it's in usd and that price won't change. If I come back the next day, it's still the same amount. Since bitcoin fluctuates, my wallet yesterday could be different from today.  Make sense? Plz help lol",2021-01-21 19:36:23

In the process I've lost out on several thousand dollars in gains plus a lot of extra stress and anxiety.

After doing some serious thinking, re-evaluation, and taking some good advice from a number of posts here, I've decided once and for all to give this approach up. While some may be good at this, I'm terrible at it. And it's obvious that, while the markets will remain volatile for the foreseeable future, cryptocurrency is here to stay and will almost certainly continue an uptrend for years to come, even if that means bear market periods. It takes too much time, emotion, and energy to babysit the market trying to catch the highs and lows, while also moving currency between wallets and exchanges. It's exhausting.

Most of them disappeared within about 2 years of launch despite raising millions of dollars. [Here‚Äôs some more context.](https://deadcoins.com/) 

This is how I personally determine if a blockchain project has potential or not. You are more than welcome to add your insights in the comments section. Hopefully, this post can save you some time and money.

- Team‚Äôs Credibility: Go to their LinkedIn profile and check their previous history. Are they calling themselves‚Äúblockchain experts‚Äù after 2 years of working in an ICO company? I always like to find teams run by real developers who joined a project to build a real product.
- Online presence: Do they have a Linkedin company page? [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ethereum)? Do they have a subreddit or any sort of group where the community can ask questions about the project? Do they have a history of kicking people from their subreddit only because they asked some hard questions?
- Code: I‚Äôm not a developer but I do understand that a company‚Äôs Github page activity can tell you a lot about their team and community. If they have one, you can go to their Github page and check it out. Some sites like [Coinpaprika](https://coinpaprika.com/social?sort%5Bsort%5D=social_github_stars&sort%5Bsortorder%5D=desc)let you check the Github stars, commits, and contributors.
- Progress: Are they declaring that they are going to change the entire industry in few months but don‚Äôt even have a live product yet? That‚Äôs a warning sign in most cases.
- Marketing: Blockchain marketing is different than marketing in other industries. The main reason? The community. We can make a projected rise or fall just by liking it on /r/cc. Blockchain companies focus on high-quality blockchain marketing campaigns. [Here‚Äôs a great resource](https://guerrillabuzz.com/blockchain-marketing/) that explains how you can run a blockchain marketing campaign in the right way.
- Design: When a company has a great design and copywriting that makes their ideas easily understandable, it means they understand the importance behind branding and are more likely to get people outside their blockchain market to hear about them.
- Do they solve a real-life problem? Or do they just sound good and use dozens of buzz words?",2021-01-21 01:32:43

I'm thinking about several things. A domain that no one owns, perhaps an unstoppable domain like *.crypto  that is somehow maintained by the decentralized system.

Also, users could run server nodes (like cardano, Tezos etc), sharing their bandwidth and hdd space. And get paid to do it, how? By Ads, the system should be able to accept crypto for ads, and the crypto rewards for those ads would be shared among the server nodes.

Except that I didn‚Äôt make a cent. I only bought the ETH to pay monies owed to an overseas relative. It just happened to be during the dip. He quickly converted it to fiat because we both got burned last cycle, and were worried that ETH would continue to slide.

I look back on that and kick myself. Sure, I did what made sense at the time, and have benefited from the experience. But you try like hell to buy the dips, and the one time that you nail it it is a complete and temporary fluke.

Proposal: Change MOONs distribution to be sublinear rather than linear,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l1qds3/proposal_change_moons_distribution_to_be/,1,CryptoCurrency,19,"Currently, MOONs are distributed _linearly_ and _proportionally_ to karma contributions.

That means that if Alice has N√ó Bob's contribution karma, Alice gets N√ó the MOONs that Bob will get (notwithstanding bonuses or other proposals that may be in effect). For example, if Alice has 2,000 contribution karma and Bob has 100 contribution karma, **then Alice gets 20√ó the MOONs that Bob gets**.

This proposal would change the linear proportional distribution to **a sub-linear distribution.**

That means that if Alice has N√ó Bob's contributions, she gets (N^(0.9))√ó the MOONs that Bob will get. For example, if Alice has 2,000 contribution karma and Bob has 100 contribution karma, **then Alice gets (20^(0.9))√ó the MOONs that Bob gets (~14.8√ó)**. Given the fixed pot of MOONs, Bob gets a little more and Alice gets a little less.

Enacting this proposal has the following effects:

* Doesn't affect the relative contribution ranking of users each month. If you contributed more to the community, you still get more MOONs.

* Doesn't cap the amount of MOONs you can earn, unlike some similar proposals. There is no limit to the number of MOONs someone can earn in a month.

* Reduces the extremes between the top end of contributions and the bottom end of contributions. This month the top MOON-earner will earn **~23,350√ó** the MOONs that the bottom MOON-earner will earn; under this proposal they would earn **~8,540√ó** as much instead.

* The biggest winners from this proposal are people who aren't in the top few percentage points of MOON-generators each month, but who have consistently good contribution records.

* This doesn't affect people with minimal contributions very much, though they will get incrementally more.

* Smooths out the ""runaway effect"" of wildly popular posts/comments to reflect the diminishing marginal utility of such posts/comments.

I've done a fair amount of research, and wanted more options and to move to a less expensive trading platform, so I started the move to Kraken.

I flipped a few of my coins over and I really don't like the lack of historical portfolio performance, one thing I think Coinbase handled well.  So I decided I'd open ANOTHER account at Delta to keep an eye on my portfolio, and while I like it, it straight up is not working with Kraken; only shows initial transfers from when I opened the account, nothing else.  Right now it shows the USDC I transferred, the intial ETH transfer, and negative $200 for ADA; so it's not tracking actively apparently.  I've rechecked the settings and relinked, still not working.  I just completely redid the app, and Kraken is all 0s.  Coinbase works fine. 

I feel like it shouldn't be this difficult to keep and eye on my portfolio, especially considering I haven't even moved to a physical wallet yet.  

So I guess it comes down to...am I missing something with Kraken?  Is Delta just misfiring and will work fine soon?  Is there a better way?  I'm open.  Ideally I'd like to track on Android.

Time and again, someone is entering stacks of small orders (down to thousandths or ten thousandths of a BTC), sometimes upwards of a 100 or more at a time, at sell prices that are progressively $30-$100 less than the current market price (which makes no sense unless you're intentionally trying to drive the price down). The market then has to retrace those steps, and then as soon as it goes up a few hundred, it happens again. 

This is what is causing the gradual decline and a lot of the big money to be sitting on the sidelines: after all, why buy now when the market keeps coming to you every time you step in?

Governments Have No Arguments Against Bitcoin Really,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l19dam/governments_have_no_arguments_against_bitcoin/,7,CryptoCurrency,17,"It's really funny to think that there are only two arguments that government officials give about why Bitcoin is bad.

They say it's volatile.
They say criminals use it.

And that's all?

I stand to be corrected, Bitcoin is volatile because it's an emerging asset. Almost every asset, including newly listed IPOs have the same trait, and some stocks for God's sake have more downside volatility than BTC these days.

Historically, anyone who has held BTC within a three years time frame almost always ends up in profit.


Criminals use BTC, and so?

So, there were no criminals before Bitcoin was invented? Even a large chunk of money laundering activities are financed via banks and cash transaction.

See this story from yesterday for instance:

[Bitcoin Isn‚Äôt the Bad Boy: Aussie Banks Launder $385 million for Cocaine Cartels]

https://coinfomania.com/aussie-banks-launder-385-million/


Bitcoin constitutes just an inconsiderable fraction of the crime numbers. So, why make it a hot topic?

I read a Reddit comment where someone likened BTC to an axe. You can use it to chop a tree or chop someone's head. So, you'll stop using an axe because it can cut people's head?

Indeed, if these are the main reasons why they say BTC is bad, then I don't think it's worth listening to. 

In fact, it's more reason to buy more.

At this point, I plan to try to continue making these posts until I have completed a full year.¬†

-If you decide to reply, please add something more than, ""scam"" or ""this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020"". Please say why. If it is a scam, link or show evidence. If you feel it is a true moonshot, what makes this project special with that sort of potential? It seems many people within this community only promote projects they are financially invested in, while trash talking coins they do not hold bags.¬†


-I strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. There is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. You may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. I know I certainly did!

Pi & Bee Network Scam | Part 1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l0p6sh/pi_bee_network_scam_part_1/,203,CryptoCurrency,124,"*Due to the increased surge of people sharing this stuff again on social media, I felt (and presumably many others here) need to address this type of content.*

I know the Pi and Bee gang will be downvoting this to oblivion but this needs to be said. 

Anyway, I have had 10 affiliate links sent to me on social media to sign up to both Pi and Bee. I just wanted to urge everyone DO NOT download these apps without reading this.

Pi has been round for years now, constantly promising some made up bullshit. Bee, I haven‚Äôt read to much into BEE but it‚Äôs probably the exact same and the app developer *Bee Games* pretty much sums it up.

I know what you‚Äôre thinking, what makes you have right to make these types of comments? 

First of all, in respect to this I would like to say, pi has been in ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô since 2018. No open source content and the app just provides a non-monetary value on screen which simulates ‚Äúmining‚Äù this isn‚Äôt mining. If anything this is just a ‚Äútracking‚Äù method used to deploy tokens/coins (if somehow ended up on mainnet).

The actual content on these non-existent coins are limited to what the website/app tells you. Little to no research has been done into this because it‚Äôs so enclosed. 

People try and sell you this dream with these types of pointless things to gain more imaginary tokens. Using MLM/Ponzi tactics to gain more users is shady af. 

The team may have PhD‚Äôs and may be legit but these people are not doing this for free. There are so many factors you would encounter researching the ‚Äòteam‚Äô. 

Closed source, little information, bullshit marketing, MLM/Ponzi tactics is extremely shady. You‚Äôre probably going to ask, well what do I have to lose even if it‚Äôs not real.

I mean let‚Äôs just start with your personal data, constantly capturing data whilst using your phone?
YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS WORTH MORE TO YOU THEN ANY CRYPTO. 

I know most of you know this and can see through this shady shit but this is more for the newer/less experienced people out there. 

Secondly to this, intermittent ads deploying to the app every now and then will also benefit the creators of the app considering millions of people use this pointless thing.

Thirdly, the economics and tokenomics as an example would be as follows. 

Let‚Äôs say the average person ‚Äúmines‚Äù 5000 Pi/Bee 
100 million when/if goes to main net and get listed on an exchange
That would mean the total supply of this token/coin would be 500 BILLION. 

Price comparison/Prediction:
Let‚Äôs say it has the rough price of BTT (nearly 1trillion supply) *divided by 2* so current price of $0.0001897 give or take, so that would mean your 5k Pi/Bee would be worth less than a dollar! 1 USD for all your personal data. Bargain!

If you‚Äôre in crypto and you‚Äôre using these apps then I would change emails and phone numbers. 

On the AppStores it literally says that the company will be using your personal data and will introduce KYC gradually. Currently 8th on social media list (Apple App Store) 

‚ÄúSocialchain‚Äù is the owner of pi app and website, there is very little information connecting these two but Pi gets shadier every time I try to research about it.

I will be hosting a part two with further investigations, sources and technicalities, but for now just wanted to make people vigilant about this crap.

Conclusion TDLR: 
Your personal data is worth more than $1 or in the current situation *free* 
Pi and Bee are pointless and currently non-existent. 
Please stop promoting this shit and making people download it with a dream of being the next Bitcoin as it‚Äôs not going to be.

Edit: Part 2 (Pi Network Scam) has been posted, some pretty interesting stuff has come to light, such as a court case between 2 of the 3 members of Pi‚Äôs team.

Edit 3: in terms of KYC, questions have been asked on Pi‚Äôs Reddit, mods commenting ‚Äúproviding personal data to a financial company is a normal thing to do‚Äù ~ this would be the case but Pi is not a financial company or any company at all for that matter. DO NOT GIVE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION
Kyc will have to be completed before ‚Äústage 3‚Äù of the bullshit plan.",2021-01-20 07:26:57
Part 2 (Pi Network Scam),https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l0y4je/part_2_pi_network_scam/,52,CryptoCurrency,35,"The massive difference a little research can do is amazing. 
So after spending a couple of hours I have come to some interesting details some of which haven‚Äôt been communicated directly to anyone via Pi or direct affiliates.

So following on from part 1; 

From researching briefly; I am able to find the following: 

Ongoing court case: found on docketalarm (provides litigation alerts, legal filings and search tools for the US court system) 

Between ya bois
Vincent McPhillip vs Nicolas Kokkalis et al
20CV368601 | California State, Santa Clara County, Superior Court :
Wrongful termination unlimited (36) 

I have found the following about each team member: 

Not too much info on Vincent, from making his own t shirt design start up and borrowing money off his ma doing so, being in Stanford‚Äôs blockchain club ‚Äúblockchaincollective‚Äù with our man Nicolas Kokkalis but no sign of the other team member in that club. Personally, I think Vincent has a passion for blockchains but most probably got involved with Nicolas Kokkalis too much, orrrrr he‚Äôs just as bad and doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about anyone? 

What I found about Nicolas Kokkalis is that he owns a company called Gameyola, this company provides a monetization and distribution platform for casual Flash games on social networks, sound familiar? This company received an undisclosed amount of $ from Fbfund which at the time, was chaired by Chamath Palihapitiya, which also was VP of Facebook‚Äôs user growth. Now Billionaire. 

I can‚Äôt find any tangible information about Dr. Chengdiao Fan unfortunately.

So, further investigations into the app itself; socialchain inc, the output for the app, cannot be found anywhere on any corporate databases in the US. Furthermore it links to a website socialchain. app which also links to the privacy policy for the app itself and options to sign in option which is linked to Facebook. 

During a swift read of the privacy policy for the app, which I have to mention hasn‚Äôt been updated since 2018 I come across the following:

Information automatically collected when you use our services
When you use our services, we collect information about your usage of our apps, activities you have through our servers, such as what virtual goods you choose to send, how many you send, the number of friends you invite to our apps.
Device Information. We collect device-specific information, such as the hardware model, operating system version, advertising identifier, unique application identifiers, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, wireless network, and mobile network information (including the mobile phone number).

Location Information.When you use our services we may collect information about your location. With your consent, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.

* the pages or features of our Site to which a user browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, the frequency with which the Site is used by a user, search terms, the links on our Site that a user clicked on or used, and other statistics.

Scary stuff. 

Full details of this should be read and fully understood to the extent of this entire wording is counter-intuitive. It‚Äôs okay saying well Facebook, Twitter and even Reddit has these types of wordings etc, but the massive difference here is, those that are downloading this are giving their personal data to an unknown entity that has no physical address listed and isn‚Äôt even registered.  (If they are registered, they should display this) they have also listed they‚Äôre not responsible for any mishandling of data, so again think about it, would you download it after reading this?

Apologies for being so long-winded with this one. Everyone should have a right to privacy, even the gullible ones and shit like this shouldn‚Äôt be shoved down peoples throats as grand marketing scheme. 

Splitting part 2 into 2, didn‚Äôt realise Pi would be this long. BEE ready for the part 2.2 coming soon.

Can CryptoCurrency survive the next 4 years?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l1ephc/can_cryptocurrency_survive_the_next_4_years/,3,CryptoCurrency,25,"This post is not intended to be a partisan attack but with one party having all the control in Washington it appears that more radical action can be taken by the administration without being hampered by the opposition party. I present the following scenario and welcome any efforts to find flaws in my logic:

1. The administration decides for whatever reason that it needs to control Bitcoin.
2. There is a report of Bitcoin being used to finance ""extremist"" activities.
3. The government contracts out with one or more cloud providers to spin up a sufficient number of Bitcoin nodes in order for it to control the distributed ledger.
4. The government identifies a person that it considers an extremist who also owns some Bitcoin.
5. The government confiscates that person's Bitcoin by writing the transfer into the ledger. Since the government controls the ledger now the transfer is considered to be valid.
6. This person complains online and to the media that his Bitcoin was confiscated by the government for no reason and he received no compensation.
7. Other Bitcoin holders find out that the government now controls the ledger and try to cash out immediately.
8. Since the news of the government's control of the ledger has come out, very few people want to buy Bitcoin.
9. With a very large number of sellers and very few buyers, the price of Bitcoin collapses.
10. Holders of other cryptocurrencies see what has happened with Bitcoin and attempt to unload their holdings causing those cryptocurrencies to collapse as well.

This may sound like a conspiracy theory to some but I find it very plausible. The government can use any number of justifications to do this:

* Extremist activity
* Tax avoidance
* Environmental issues (nodes using too much power)

The bit problem is that I don't see who is going to come and defend Bitcoin other than the people who hold the currencies. Governments around the world do not like people having alternatives to the official currency, Big Tech is not able to track purchases made with crypto, people who are in dire economic straits have little sympathy for those who have made large sums of  money using something they do not understand.

Anybody care to refute my reasoning?",2021-01-21 07:38:12

My major pro for Coinbase is it‚Äôs FDIC insured while Kraken is not. And as far as I have heard, Kraken got outstanding Customer Service while Coinbase customer service is really bad. Plus Kraken got more coins too. 

People who is living in USA, what are your thoughts on Coinbase? And Kraken ? Which one do you guys prefer ? And what are your pros and cons for these two exchanges ?

Hey, instead of just hodling your coins, and waiting, how about learning to become a developer instead? Today, you will learn how anyone can become a blockchain developer.

Just to set your expectation, Blockchain development requires a different approach. It is not similar to web development, which makes it far more complex.

Leveraged Trading Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l1hn2t/leveraged_trading_question/,1,CryptoCurrency,5,"Pardon me for this very basic question, but it seems as though I'm misunderstanding leveraged trading.

Read up a little on it and the basic concept I walked away with was:  
\*Leveraged trading allows you to multiply the risk/reward based on your assets  
Aka; if you buy eth on leverage for 5x then you would be on the hook for 5x the loss if it dips or gain 5x the profit if it rises.

But it seems not to be working that way.  
Using Kraken, I applied a leveraged trade for .183 eth at 5x leverage while eth is at $1321.64. (Using small amounts to try to get a feel for it)  
.183 x 1321.64 = $241.86 for the starting price.

I then closed said position when eth hit $1348.8.  
.183 x 1348.8 = $246.83

And that's what I received. I was under the impression that it would be the profit (\~$5) times 5 for the leverage multiplier; leaving me with \~$266.86 at the end of it.

What happened seems to be as it would have been had I just bought the eth sans leverage; what did the leverage do?",2021-01-21 09:53:19

I am sorry for posting this, since I know there are a lot of posts about DCA already. I‚Äôve read through all of the posts discussing the methods of investing, and so I‚Äôd like to ask you for your feedback on my plan.

I already have some crypto that I bought years ago, but I‚Äôd like to get back to it, and stick to a regular long-term investing plan.

So I am a college student, which means that I am quite limited on my budget.

I said to myself that during bull runs, I would invest around 10 euros weekly, and during major dips, or during bear runs, that would be 20 or more euros weekly, so that I could get more BTC while the price is good.

Meaning that it wouldn‚Äôt be just DCA, but a dynamic DCA.

Would you say that this plan could work out, or if it is a wise one? How would you invest while being a student?

I‚Äôd like to lump sum if I could (which apparently has a better return value), but it‚Äôs not like I am sitting on a pile of cash at the moment. I‚Äôd just like to invest for five+ years.",2021-01-21 03:12:27
