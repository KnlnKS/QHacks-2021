Announcing the Bitcoin Core Usage Survey,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l0t1g7/announcing_the_bitcoin_core_usage_survey/,125,Bitcoin,55,"Today I'm launching the Bitcoin Core usage survey. This survey is aimed at gathering information about how people use Bitcoin Core so that we can improve it in the future. If you have any feedback about Bitcoin Core that you want to share, this survey is a great place to do that.

[Click here to take the survey](https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6081474/8acd79087feb)

As I know that many people are concerned about their privacy, this survey is designed to protect your privacy as much as possible. The survey is configured so that there are no trackers and no IP information is stored. Even so, if you want to use Tor, feel free to do so. I've tested that Tor doesn't break the survey (no annoying CAPTCHAs and no broken JS). Questions that ask for any information that could be identifying or privacy revealing are either optional or have an ""opt out"" type of answer.

For more information about the survey which breaks down why each question is being asked, see this blog post: https://achow101.com/2021/01/bitcoin-core-survey

The survey will be up until March 2nd.",2021-01-20 10:26:40

$100k loan YOLO - update 23rd Jan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l34bd8/100k_loan_yolo_update_23rd_jan/,13,Bitcoin,18,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kkj69d/im_putting_10000_from_three_unsecured_personal/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

That 30% drawdown saw my total bitcoin stack fall by $99,000 (From $317k to $218k). That’s a huge sum of money for me to ‘lose’. Especially as bitcoin makes up a very high percentage of my net worth. 

However; I’m still up on my investment, my conviction remains as strong as ever, I will not be shaken out, I’m still HODLing! I haven’t decided on when to take profit to pay back the loan. I’m currently thinking around $160,000 BTC.

I’ll post again in a couple of months time. Keep stacking brothers!

Edit: to be clear $99k drop was on my total stack. I used $90k of the loan to buy 3.547 BTC (kept $10k as cash reserve) which is currently valued at $115,600. So I am up $25,600.",2021-01-23 17:07:56

Bitcoin King of the Hill,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l32yd3/bitcoin_king_of_the_hill/,8,Bitcoin,62,"Alright so I contemplated sharing this for quite some time. I'm a software developer who's been interested/invested in crypto since around 2016. I've been slowly working on a crypto ""game"" that I'd like to hear some feedback on. The name of the game is, as the title mentions, Bitcoin King of the Hill. Here's the premise:

&#x200B;

For a 1 hour period, a single Bitcoin address is the King of the Hill. Their address is posted publicly at the top of the website. If you want your address to be the next King of the Hill, you have to send at least 0.0005 BTC to the current King of the Hill address. After the hour is up, an address is chosen (at random) that sent 0.0005 BTC to the King of the Hill address. That new address becomes the new King, and they receive all the 0.0005 BTC transactions for the next hour until a new King is chosen.

&#x200B;

Fairly simple in theory, but I'd love to hear a couple things:

1) I'm based out of the US. Do you think this is even a legal project? I'm not paying out to people's addresses directly. I'm essentially just facilitating many peer-to-peer transactions.

2) Would you take a chance to be the King of the Hill?

Can't wait to hear your responses!",2021-01-23 15:46:26

So sick of this Bitcoin bias in the media lately,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l2vuwk/so_sick_of_this_bitcoin_bias_in_the_media_lately/,16,Bitcoin,24,"I'm so sick of the constant negative press lately from all the major outlets.

Yesterday was the worst.

After CoinTelegraph irresponsibly reported there was a double spend in btc for the first time in history, the same day outlets have been writing about Janet Yellen being anti-bitcoin, and how btc was dropping like a rock...all over the news, every site, every feed for the last few days.

Today, the double spend story turned out to be incorrect (never happened and in fact, was debunked by the same firm that found it a few hours later but the media already ran with the story anyways), while at the same time, Janet Yellen publishes a formal response to her hearing stating she's essentially in favor of crypto (the exact opposite of what the media kept saying for the last few days), and on the same day, btc rebounds 16% in less than 24 hours., right after a brutal correction.

I have yet to see more than one retraction or correction for any of these stories...a lot of them are still running in Google news feeds and Yahoo Finance. It's insane.

If I'm new to btc, the stories I see today are

* Bitcoin can be double spent
* Treasury secretary Yellen wants to ban crypto and
* Bitcoin dropped 30% this week, run for the hills!

The stories SHOULD be:

* Bitcoin double spend never happened
* Yellen actually praised crypto
* Bitcoin rebounded significantly one day after the drop

I've been waiting all day and still, nothing. Just all the old negative stories from yesterday still cloughing up my news feeds.

I'm not expecting news outlets to be writing positive articles of bitcoin all the time (unless it's warranted). I'm just expecting they would correct blatant falsehoods and clickbait once they've been completely debunked and incorrectly reported.

EDIT: The worst part is  all these stories being published at the same time probably helped cause this dip in the first place. Still, they don't correct it. They just move on after they've done their damage.",2021-01-23 09:38:06

I've been in crypto since 2017, been putting all my extra cash into the markets since then. Been active in communites and definitely confident about the future of crypto.

Ill skip to my fuckup.

I had recently decided to trade using leverage, started small and ""did my research"".

Today, I saw an opportunity with bitcoins sideways pullback and supports, and I was confident. Too confident. i bought in at 20x leverage, things were going well, i bought a bit above the bottom, and then bought in again nearly perfectly getting the reversal.

Here is my series of mistakes that turned into a big fuckup: Normally ill judge the bounce and buy in again on the ride up if im confident, small fluctuations in price wont get me liquidated, wait, not get too greedy and close.

I decided to use 125x leverage on my last buy. Dumb i know. but still, it was my smallest buy and i was confident in the returns, if theres a fluctuation i'd just add to the position.

I clicked 125x, didnt read the warning i got, ( after all, time is money)

and then,  something seemed off. I only had One position open. Then, tiny fluctuation, i see -50%, -80%, panic a bit and try to close. Boom, Liquidated.

I didnt know that the Entire position goes 125x.

Entire balance of over 3 years. wiped.

Dont be as reckless as me. I't feels like shit.

Im going to slowly try and rebuild.. Staying meathodical and being much more conservative with my risk.

But fuck, this sucks.

edit 1: [Didn't see these till after lmao](https://imgur.com/a/UY7wsse). Testament to volatility.

Edit 2: Want to let yall know that i appreciate all the comments. I was fine with the loss after a couple hours, its just money invested in myself to learn and grow as a person and trader.

Bitcoin vs Ethereum transactions and fees stats are misleading,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l32ooc/bitcoin_vs_ethereum_transactions_and_fees_stats/,3,Bitcoin,2,"Recently I have seen lot of people on Twitter sharing charts, numbers, websites etc. comparing number of transactions and fees involved to somehow conclude one network is better than other or used more.

This is misleading and I was surprised to see [Jacob Franek](https://twitter.com/panekkkk/status/135248892825168281), Co-founder of Coinmetrics unaware of things mentioned in their own article or paid by Consensys, EF etc. to shill Ethereum:

> The third column is txCount. That refers to the number of transactions happening on the public blockchain a day. Be aware that for low-fee blockchains, it’s really easy to fabricate a whole bunch of transactions. So this isn’t necessarily that reliable! Additionally, UTXO networks like Bitcoin can batch a whole bunch of transactions into one, so txCount underestimates those ones. You have to therefore be careful comparing the number of transactions on Ethereum with Bitcoin; by its very nature, Bitcoin typically has more transactions than that datapoint suggests. Naively comparing the UTXO to account based systems by transaction count is like watching motorway traffic and comparing the number of buses versus motorcycles to guess at how many people are making trips. Maybe there are the same number of buses and motorcycles – but each bus might have 50 people inside of it.

"The case of block number 666,...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l2uthq/the_case_of_block_number_666/,9,Bitcoin,4,"The recent ""double-spend"" transaction is all over the news causing panic amongst many people including investors and enthusiasts who thought that bitcoin could not double spend. 

Double spend is when you intentionally replace a transaction so that the money you sent comes back to your own wallet.  

The transaction that occurred on block 666,833 is *not* such a case. It was a mix of RBF (Replace by fee) and one block reorganization (something used by miners)

About 0.00062063 BTC was sent with the low fee (1 sat/byte) causing confirmation delays. The sender later replaced the transaction with a higher fee to speed up confirmation (this is called RBF and normal in bitcoin txs). 

But due to [block reorganization](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/chain-reorganisation) both the transactions happened, [one of the valid chain](https://www.blockonomics.co/api/tx?txid=a13c2bdefcd51ef2a162f232179676c848b853b11596ac3381b70726758cfd41&addr=1D6aebVY5DbS1v7rNTnX2xeYcfWM3os1va) and the [other on the invalid or rejected chain](https://www.blockonomics.co/api/tx?txid=9e19bc72f3b9bb23351311f88dc6f5c2e7a209a4fb0ad80b35d50f765e343e29) (hence it does not show up anymore on the blockchain)

"From one noob, to another, here's what bitcoin taught me",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l2nn85/from_one_noob_to_another_heres_what_bitcoin/,18,Bitcoin,30,"I just started stacking Sats early in December. I've been familiar with Bitcoin for years but I've never invested money, until recently. My cash sat, as cash gaining a measly $0.02 a month until I'd be bored/ sad and spend my cash savings. 10+ years of waste.

Then I found the joy of stacking sats.
 First off, if you don't believe bitcoin is gonna be 100k+ one day, it's not for you. 
But if you do, this is a golden opportunity!
If you buy one sat.. you will always have 1 sat. Even if it crashes for a bit your 1 sat is still 1 sat. And now it's cheaper to get even more! With stocks you run the risk of it never making a come back. The company going under and your stocks being worthless.
But if you believe bitcoin will bounce back, why panic?
I bought in, early December around 25-30k. Then kept adding sats, everything that isn't for rent/ food/ emergency, just keep adding sats. This is the easiest, safest, long term bet if you believe in bitcoin, long term.
And if you don't why are you here?
My average sat price is about 41k- but I'm happy it dipped. I'll be stacking more, and I hope you can too. Don't panic. Enjoy the ride, and the good habit of investing in yourself and your future.

NEVER BUY BITCOIN FROM coin.me aka coinstar kiosks,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l34by4/never_buy_bitcoin_from_coinme_aka_coinstar_kiosks/,1,Bitcoin,15,"I'd like to share what seems like some kind of scam on coin.me wether its intentional or not. I wanted to buy bitcoin to buy something online at a discount. I needed 180 worth plus whatever fees. I go to a coinstar kiosk and put in 200. 4% is taken out leaving me with 192 and the value of the bitcoin was $34,523 at the time. I drive back to my house, literally 5 minute drive. Redeem the voucher and the 192 is now worth 179 and bitcoin itself is worth 32,000+. I chalk it up to bad luck, so I drive back and put in another $10. This time the bitcoin at the time of purchase was 34,700+. So I figure some of my money must have come back. So I go home (another 5 minute drive), and the value of the bitcoin is still at 32,000+ despite it just saying 34,000+ at the time of purchase for the 2nd voucher. My total barely raised by 50 cents. I cash in the voucher and it is valued at $9 and something cents. Now this could be a coincidence and maybe bitcoin does normally fluctuate that fast by 5% at a time back and forth over a 20 minute period but I really suspect that the [coin.me](https://coin.me) kiosk is selling the bitcoins and representing them at a higher value and then when you redeem your voucher you receive the actual value. Just seems sketch to me and I think buying it online through bank account seems more trustworthy after this experience. Especially if you're buying the bitcoin for the purpose of using it as a form of payment. If this isn't suspicious and I'm being a paranoid idiot then please tell me so but I wanted to warn people of a possible scam. It could be very possible that maybe the kiosk does not update the bitcoin as fast as it should but that doesn't seem very likely. This also was my first experience with cryptocurrency so it's also very possible that I'm just an idiot. Just wanted to share.",2021-01-23 17:08:56

I just lost $750k net worth and I’m not selling,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l2eydt/i_just_lost_750k_net_worth_and_im_not_selling/,74,Bitcoin,132,"First, my annual income has ranged quite wildly from $100-180k for over a decade but I also live in an expensive metropolitan area where 1,500 sq ft of a condo or modest single-family home sells for $1.5m. I went to a financial advisor for the first time a few months back and they called me earnestly, ""solidly middle class."" So, $750k is significant.

I bought about $50k over various buys in 2013-2014. At the time, I’d say that was about 15% of my net worth (all of which I earned, I am no trust fund baby).

I have never once sold any bitcoin. All purchases go right into cold storage. I watched all the big dips. 30-50% drops in violently fast intervals. Long recoveries. Never touched it.

I’m no hero HODLer. In fact, I hate that term. It’s childish, and not in an oh-so-cool-for-the-Internet way. People with any kind of positive net worth have portfolios. You don’t HODL. You have assets in various instruments. Some on paper, some as property. You’re “HODLing” all of them. You’re sometimes reallocating, but largely you choose a mix and leave it alone. To say you HODL just tells me you’ve never had anything other than a cash savings account and probably a mountain of debt.

So why do I hold bitcoin and not sell it? For many reasons already espoused endlessly on this forum, but here’s a simple take I don’t see often: If one bitcoin is worth $1, it’s basically worth over $1 million. It’s either valueless or should be priced at whatever would account for the entire world’s business conducted in direct btc transactions with no fiat ramps. There is no in between. Because bitcoin either works or it doesn’t, and the objective fact is: it works. It has worked since 2009 when the open source software was released to the world.

Ask an average Joe anywhere in the world: “Is bitcoin proven, working software or just a prototype?” and I bet 9/10 say the latter. The mainstream narrative of bitcoin is so laden with bullshit, most people simply do not know that bitcoin just works and has worked since the beginning.

Its promise is to allow two entities to transfer value without any middleman, and that the value cannot be counterfeit. This has not changed. If you transferred coins to an address generated in 2009, they sit at that address today still. Any free wallet software today will let you access it. The original client and its variations have been iterated, but bitcoin is still just a ledger, shared by thousands of volunteered machines online. And the deflationary economic philosophy -- a limited supply of coins -- chosen by its original creator, is the same and will always be.

For all the endless talk of how the protocol, the thousands of pointless crypto copies, and decentralization is a platform that can change every industry… it all doesn’t matter. Maybe the other applications will happen meaningfully, maybe they won’t. But the first software devised which runs the largest network, and a permanent, immutable economic policy that is the polar opposite of MMT and the state-run money of every country around the world, \*\*has already happened\*\*.

Bitcoin’s price moves so much because most people are simply idiots. The “speculative asset” narrative is self-fulfilling. There’s nothing to speculate. Bitcoin works. Will it be adopted, won’t it be? It IS adopted. When one person agreed to hand over a product or service for some amount of coin, it was adopted.

The single biggest thing that slowed its \*widespread\* adoption was government making a coffee purchase a taxable event (i.e. defining bitcoin as property). If we weren’t concerned about bureaucratic friction, we’d just spend what we must and save the rest. Like money is supposed to work. Instead, we hoard. And the dumb players crash in and crash out, creating and riding their own mania, but never really understanding anything.

Screw every person — with ill will or just ignorance — that says it has no inherent value. It is technology with measurable demand. It is finite, it is impossible to counterfeit, it is instantly and safely transferrable between any two parties without a middleman, and cannot be confiscated. It also cannot be uninvented. Owning it is knowledge of characters in your head and that can never be regulated away.

Again: If bitcoin is not valued at zero, then its total value should amount to the entire stored work product of the human race. Because there’s no safer place to store that value. If you think that value stored in something like fiat, which can be printed infinitely, is safer, then you’re with 98% of the rest of the world right now and you’ll continue to resent every leap in value bitcoin makes. I’ll see you at the next peak, where many more gamblers will have come and gone, but a few more who understand that fiat is garbage will be here to stay.

UPDATE: Appreciate the comments, and I guess it was ultimately a post that would be polarizing. I will say I didn't post it to flex -- I explained my financial overview so you'd understand where I'm coming from and not just be another doomsayer or to-the-mooner with no context. I put moderate risk for me in relatively early, I've benefited on paper. I've neither sold at the wrong time or the right time. I just researched the tech 8 years ago, and have seen nothing over that time to suggest anything was wrong with the first conclusion that this a game-changer and store of value worth holding for the long haul. Is it a non-flex to note I drive a 10-year old POS?

The thing is, you can't win. If you say you have no bitcoin, then you clearly don't believe in it. If you do have it, then apparently you just want others to fund the ponzi scheme. Something that benefits from a network effect does not mean those already participating can only have ulterior motives. ",2021-01-22 16:55:58

Why people get so angry when you debunk their delusional myths about bitcoin security,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l315gv/why_people_get_so_angry_when_you_debunk_their/,0,Bitcoin,35,"# A. The hate comments on my previous Bitcoin security article

I recently made a post in which I constructed a relatively simple attack on a cold-storage wallet. I used this attack to illustrate the fact that cold storage will not protect your funds if your cold-wallet software happens to be compromised.

The goal was to remind users of the importance of the [reproducible-build](https://reproducible-builds.org) software engineering standard. Without reproducible build, you simply have no security, irrespective of any cargo cult that involves hardware wallets or other ritual objects and artefacts that are nowadays in widespread use for pleading for mercy and appeasing the security gods.

I was quite surprised to see the very negative reactions to my security advisory.

The anger of quite a few users went through the roof. Therefore, I simply decided to remove my post. In the future, I will try to reintroduce the same idea and improve the awareness of the problem more gently and at a much slower pace.

# B. Why are people so angry when you debunk their delusional myths?

There is a mathematical reason for that.

In an article that I recently posted in the mathematics forum, I pointed out the uncanny similarity between two research efforts, one in mathematics and one in psychology:

* In mathematics, we have Gödel's Second incompleteness theorem
* In psychology, we have the Dunning-Kruger effect

You can find the complete article in the following link:

[Uncanny similarity between Gödel's second incompleteness and Dunning-Kruger](https://www.reddit.com/r/mathematics/comments/l1bhx1/uncanny_similarity_between_g%C3%B6dels_second)

This is my article's non-technical conclusion:

>**4. Restatement of the second incompleteness theorem in natural language**  
>  
>If system T is arrogant enough to insist that it is adamantly sure that it can never make mistakes, then T is also guaranteed to be stupid enough to actually make them.  
>  
>**5. Similarity with Dunning-Kruger**  
>  
>[Kruger and Dunning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%e2%80%93Kruger_effect)'s 1999 study ""Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments"".  
>  
>The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability. It is related to the cognitive bias of illusory superiority and comes from people's inability to recognize their lack of ability. The bias results from an internal illusion in people of low ability. The miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self. Colloquially, people experiencing this bias are said to be ""on Mount Stupid"".

# C. Conclusion

People get angry because they are very strongly committed to their delusions. That is why debunking a myth makes you so unpopular. You will always be hated when you point out an uncomfortable truth. You will get the same reaction as when you tell a woman that she is in fact an unattractive and ugly girl. It may be the truth. However, telling her will not make you popular with her. On the contrary, she will most likely start hating you.

Hence, when you write about Bitcoin security you need a really thick skin.

I will keep doing it anyway, because I am increasingly getting used to the negative reactions.

I would even like to say to the people who engaged in hate speech in the comments on my previous article on Bitcoin security: feel free to send more insults in my general general direction. You are merely training me into better ignoring them.

Seriously, I would even like to profusely thank my digital assailants for helping me to become a stronger and more compassionate person!",2021-01-23 14:03:23

Like most of you, I started in 2017 during the bull run (around May).

I started by buying $100 a Bitcoin which was around 0.05 Bitcoin. I wanted to make a quick buck and later on sold it for around $500. through to the end of 2017 invested I around $3000 into various alt coins and had almost no Bitcoin. It was alt season and money was made.

I sold my whole position and cashed out my profits. I spent 2018-2019 on the sideline and just passively watched every few weeks.

(BIGGEST LESSON) 
It was 2019, I had nothing in crypto and I watched Bitcoin bottom at $3,000. At that time I had around $3,000 of savings and was waiting to buy, I thought it was going to go lower.... I was wrong, so wrong... 
I was greedy and wanted more, I thought I could sneak in a bit more than 1 Bitcoin but looking back now, not being in the market was dumb (A lesson for some)

I watched Bitcoin smash past $6,000 and by Mid 2019, Bitcoin was around $9,000 and I chose to buy. I had around 0.3 Bitcoin at this point.

I bought some more here and there and accumulated to 0.5 Bitcoin by around early 2020. I bought 0.2 Bitcoin during the March selloff and was flying high. I was eager to make the most of the dip even though there was mass fud.

I thought I would trade and of course lost around 0.3 Bitcoin. Back to around 0.4Bitcoin.
This was hard for me to recover and it took me a while to move on as it was a large part of my portfolio.

The rest of 2020 was about accumulating and I managed to get around 0.6 Bitcoin by Sep 2020.

As Bitcoin rose quickly from Sep to Dec 2020, I was eager to hit 1 Bitcoin quickly and 2021 would be my year. I knew it would be almost impossible to just save so I decided to go all in.

I had some gold and silver and decided to sell and convert to Bitcoin and got a bit more. I managed to find some extra funds and trade (don't trade and over leverage guys, I got lucky) abit to accumulate the remaining 0.4.

I recently bought some more BTC today during this dip to finalise the deal!


 I'm glad to say I can join the club and I'll never go back!

The process of creating Bitcoins is called mining. Transactions in the system are verified through network nodes and recorded through a public distributed ledger that we call the blockchain.  The Bitcoin story starts in 2008 with an anonymous founder called Satoshi Nakamoto. During this time, Nakamoto shared a post titled, “Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper”.  The message also gave a link to Bitcoin white paper called, “Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer Electronic cash system”.

To be specific, the method was the following:

Someone sends a satoshi to a wallet, then asks for it back.

Need advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l2ml9j/need_advice/,2,Bitcoin,9,"Hi guys,

I’ve recently found out about Bitcoin and tbh have been researching it over the last few weeks. I missed the chance to buy some at £14000 but wanted to get in now.

I wanted to buy some but was waiting to get some cash, I’ve managed to secure cash and have transferred it to my Coinbase account... I know it has a reputation but I’m a newbie and it what looks the easiest. 

I’ve done some digging and from what I understood yesterday’s price drop to £21000ish was actually very good value and represented a 30% drop to which there is now a possibility of a strong rise in price. Some people are saying it could further pull back in price and then rise. 

Basically I had sent money over a few hours before that price drop but the money only got to my account now. The price has risen to about £23000. 

What would you do in my shoes? Wait in the hopes of another pull back today or this coming week or just buy? I know that it doesn’t make too much of a difference for someone waiting for Bitcoin to go to six figure but still why not get the best price available.",2021-01-23 01:48:50

I was surprised that both President and Vice-President of the bank were there and they quickly admitted that they had only heard about Bitcoin in the news but that they didn't really know anything about it.

I talked with them about Bitcoin's origins after the banking crisis and it's potential use as a reserve currency or a hedge against inflation.  I described the Fed's policy on quantitative easing and they leaned in to listen closely.  We talked about how Bitcoin differs from gold in terms of utility and security, but is similar in terms of scarcity and the properties from which its value is determined.  I glossed over how all of their account records are centralized and shared only with their partner institutions, but introduced them to the decentralized nature of blockchain and how the open, distributed ledger of Bitcoin is much less anonymous than some state actors would like them to believe.

By the end of our hour-long meeting they were thanking me for my time and offering me a consultancy fee!  I told them I'm happy to come back and talk anytime because we still have important concepts such as mining and other blockchain applications to go over.  We should remember to never be afraid to share our knowledge with those who have questions about blockchain and crypto.  It seems to me like the best way to encourage adoption.

Is this insignificant enough to not affect the price of btc into the upside?

Also, just from doing my own TA, it’s clear that btc broke the support line of ~ 35k which makes sense that it dropped down to where it is now. It seems to have tested the 32k support line, broke that, which is why we dropped to about 31k. Now it seems we are attempting to reclaim the 32k trend line. 

Overall I’m happy there’s a dip because it increases the longevity of btc’s bull run; however, I am just curious about what’s actually going on here.

Dear people who curios about Satoshi-San,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l2kgdh/dear_people_who_curios_about_satoshisan/,1,Bitcoin,6,"Hi, guys !

I have interesting idea of why Satoshi-San is keeping anonymous.

&#x200B;

First, I must say that there is a 1% of the top of people in this world. you have to accept that before you continue. Ah, this is quite a long content, please stay focus...

&#x200B;

The reason why he/she/they kept anonymous because they are the fucking 1% of people separated from the fucking banks, gov and other 1%. and they don't want to be revealed.

As you can see our world nowadays clearer day to day, the money game is going to the end point of the history - trust losses, people connect to the news easier, people are more cleaver by the technology, Gov printed the overnumbered of the fiat money, etc., so they are not able to easily trick these people anymore.

And there must be something else that replaces this game...

***In conclusion, all the hardwork, Satoshi-San has made, is just another capital game that players can play across the world, same shit in the bigger scale, isn't it?***

**in the game**, there are many kind of players, but let's say there are 3 big categories

1. Controller (1%)    |     2. Investor (20%)     |    3. In-praciticing Investors. (79%)

For 1. and 2. they know the deep insight of the assets they invest, and they are just only small group of people from over 7.8 Billion lives globally.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Therefore, the 3. is the biggest group of people and they (3.) are their (1. and 2.) wealth making machines.

in the past, less people knew how the Stock market runs, so most people made loss of their capital.in the present, less people know how the cryptocurrencies run, so Most of people are going to make/ making loss of their capital.

\*\*\*\* When they loss their capital, the choices they could make are \*\*\*\*\*

>\- Fight with it --- Make more money by using their physical power - which they are praised by being called Survivor or Hard worker (but why you need to be the fucking survivor, huh?)  
>  
>\- Use the cheating formulas --- Find their useful connection and share the wealth from the 1. and 2. (by human being, it is normal to be selfish because you can't concern the people around the world.)  
>  
>\- Quit the game mentally --- they just leave the game of wealthy and true freedom by making their garden, and finding another opportunity to making more money by using such a narrow scope of natural resouces.  
>  
>\- Quit the game physically --- They do suicide.... RIP to them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So sad right? Now, let's see how the 1. and (some of) 2. do when they loss the capital (Which uneasily happened)

>\- Take a break - go vacation and find pleasure to their soul by not worried about the waste of natural resources. They can use unlimitedly !!  
>  
>\- Re-invest - As they have a lot of capital kept in their safe.  
>  
>\- Quit the game mentally - just same as the 3. do. (not everyone that rich like this capital game)  
>  
>\- Quit the game physically - I have an interesting theory on this kind of people. I think they might want to see how the afterlife is so bad that they can't stand living another day ( i.e. Chester B. from LinkinPark) OR They are just stoned af until they don't have any happiness that can replace the drugs used.

**The big important point is the FREEDOM.**

**Majority of the top 21% people have no shame to use the natural resources freedomly, and they keep annoucing that the global warming is a serious issues that everybody need to fix it (when they realised that natural resources are running out.)**

\------------

Come back to our story that why Satoshi-San are not going publically known.

Short and concise -

They don't want to be related to the group of people that control the money game,

They can make more wealth by making people believe they are on the same side. (if you don't agre with, you might be interested in seeing who control the price of crypto asset nowadays.)

"Visualizing the ""size"" of 1 Bitcoin",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l2gtgm/visualizing_the_size_of_1_bitcoin/,4,Bitcoin,11,"I have a friend who has trouble understanding how 1 bitcoin can be worth $30,000, so I tried this analogy to explain. Imagine you took all the gold in the world and minted it into 1 troy ounce gold coins. There are roughly 244,000 metric tons of gold that have been discovered in the world. A metric ton is 2204 pounds, so that's 537,927,920 pounds of gold. A pound of gold coins is 14.58 troy ounces, so that would be 7,844,782,166 troy ounce gold coins. So if you were starting a digital currency like bitcoin, and your goal was to make 1 bitcoin worth as much as 1 troy ounce gold coin, your total supply of bitcoin would be something like 7,844,782,166.

But there will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoin. That's a lot less than 7,844,782,166. In fact, 7,844,782,166 divided by 400 is 19,611,955, which is pretty close to 21,000,000. Let's just take Satoshi's 1,000,000 bitcoin off the table and call it 20,000,000 among friends. And what's the significance of dividing by 400? A good delivery gold bar is 400 troy ounces. So when Satoshi set the total bitcoin supply at 21,000,000, he wasn't aiming for 1 bitcoin to be worth as much as 1 gold coin, he was aiming for it to be worth as much as 1 gold *brick*.",2021-01-22 18:48:07

The only way reasonably “spend” bitcoin on goods and services right now is if you have a debit card that borrows against your crypto (like the Nexo card).  In that scenario you aren’t paying extra taxes, but it adds two new problems.  1. You will likely pay interest on that loan that may exceed the taxes you would have paid.  2. More importantly, this adds a trusted 3rd party to the mix which basically negates one on of the problems bitcoin is trying to solve.",2021-01-23 09:11:54

imagine a guy wants to buy two hot dogs, from two different hot dog stands, but he only has enough money on his card for one. 

He walks up to the first hot dog stand and he swipes his card, the salesman hands him the hot dog and then he sprints over to the other hot dog vendor, swipes his card and grabs the hotdog and runs off, ALL BEFORE EITHER CREDIT CARD READER SAID “approved” 

Now in reality, only one transaction will go through; the first one. It will say approved, but the second one, since the money is gone now, will say “declined” and the second hot dog vendor will be watching the guy run away with his unpaid for hot dog. 

as far as the credit card goes, no double spending occurred - only one transaction was approved and the money went to the correct, ‘first’ transaction.  But in reality, the effects of a double spend did occur, but it was human error for allowing the goods to be taken away before the transaction was approved, it had nothing to do with the fault of the network. 

If you’re selling something via Bitcoin this won’t be an issue, just wait for a few network confirmations and you’re good.",2021-01-22 14:47:08

WHY BITCOIN WILL NEVER GO TO ZERO: How Mt. Gox proved Bitcoin was here to stay.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l1qfol/why_bitcoin_will_never_go_to_zero_how_mt_gox/,138,Bitcoin,38,"Many people are skeptical about Bitcoin and somehow still believe that a \~trillion dollar asset will become worthless. Well for those who are not familiar with the history of bitcoin, there was a period of time where there was a legitimate chance that the price of the this infamous asset would actually go to zero. Here is a brief history of Mt. Gox and how significant this event was.

Mt. Gox was one of the first Bitcoin exchanges on the internet. Not only were they one of the first crypto exchanges, but they also contributed to 70% of the bitcoin volume. Considering that in these days, the total Market cap was sub 1 billion, even at times sub 1 million, this exchange had a Huge effect on the bitcoin price. The thing about Mt. Gox was that although it was the most popular bitcoin exchange, it had countless security issues. In the early years of the company trading bitcoin, someone was able to hack the computers on the Mt. Gox network and change the bitcoin price from around $17 down to $0.01. After this change in price, the hacker used the exploit to buy a bunch of bitcoin and scam many out of their holdings. Although the Mt Gox administrators were able to reduce some of the damage the hacker caused, the hacker still was able to make off with around 2,000 bitcoins. But this was only the beginning of troubles for Mt. Gox. A few years later, bitcoin was hitting it's all time high of $1,000 and for the first time ever, it was getting attention from the main stream news. With bitcoin lovers going crazy about how they were right, there was a bigger issue at play. Many of these investors kept their bitcoin on the famous exchange Mt. Gox, and for some reason, they were limiting the amount of bitcoin that could be withdrew from accounts. With growing concerns, bitcoin price started to drop fast. It went from 1k on Jan 1 2014, down to under $120 on February 24. Then on Feb. 25, Mt Gox went down and no one was able to get on. To put this in perspective, bitcoin went from a $12 Billion asset to a $1B asset in weeks. If there would be a time for bitcoin to go to zero, this would have been it. Not only was Mt. Gox down during this time, but just months before the Silk road got shut down which resulted in the government seizing 175k bitcoins, and to make matters worse Homeland security started penalizing Mt. Gox for breaking money transmitting laws, making many worried about government regulation. When Mt. Gox went back online it was discovered the site was hacked and lost around 850,000 bitcoin, around 7% of the total supply of bitcoin at the time.

Fast forward 7 years and bitcoin is approaching a 1 trillion dollar market cap, is held on the balance sheet of multibillion dollar tech companies, being traded on wall street, and is talked about on every financial TV show and podcast there is. If bitcoin was going to die, it would've died when it was worth $1B. Billion dollar assets die all the time, just look at Quibi. But when is the last time you heard of a $1T asset going to zero? Bitcoin has withheld test and trials that no other asset has ever had to go through and its still thriving. Those who say bitcoin has not withheld the test of time has not looked deeply enough into the history of bitcoin. Bitcoin has went through more tribulations in its 12 years of existence than other assets have went through in the last hundred years. Bitcoin has shown time and time again that it can not be killed and those who think otherwise are ignorant.",2021-01-21 17:26:32

How does a private key transfer from one wallet to another during a transaction?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l2hqg8/how_does_a_private_key_transfer_from_one_wallet/,1,Bitcoin,5,"I know that my title is inaccurate but I couldn't figure out a concise way to word it. Private keys represent a whole or partial bitcoin. They are kept safe in a wallet, encrypted with at least password protection hopefully. When you want to make a transaction you send out a broadcast telling nodes you want to send some of you balance to another wallet address with a fee included to bribe the nodes into actually doing it.

That's my understanding but it has a bunch of holes that lead me to the following questions:

1. How is a private key created? I would guess that it is some combination of the data from the block where that bitcoin was created and maybe the transaction block that sent that bitcoin to your wallet. The problem is that all of this is public information. For the private key to be private some secret needs to enter into the equation but this contradicts my understanding that every part of the bitcoin protocol happens out in the open, other than  the fact that you don't know other wallets private keys, but as I explained I don't know by what mechanism we don't know other people private keys.

2. When you broadcast a transaction the nodes need to verify that your private key does infact unlock the bitcoin that you are trying to send. This means sharing your private keys. Previously i have attempted transactions with fees so low that nodes ignored it and it failed. Why would this be safe? If that transaction required me to share my private keys then howare my keys still secret? Do i have new keys, perhaps created by yet another clever mechanism?",2021-01-22 19:49:39

I decided with this run im not going to trade, just do a bimonthly investment on each paycheck and possibly buy some dips. Just so happened today was payday on a dip, perfect timing for my first DCA buy.

Currently, bitcoin syncs the blocks in order when the node is started for the first time, but I knew that there is a faster approach. Since knowing the hash of the previous block is cheaper than knowing the hash of the next one, I think that they should change it so that it syncs backward from a hardcoded checkpoint all the way back to the genesis block, and then continues to sync forward normally. This will speed up the blockchain sync by eliminating the need to verify the blocks that are synced in backward order. To top it off, backward blockchain sync from hardcoded checkpoint can even improve security.",2021-01-22 15:03:47

Sold it all today - my story since 2013,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l1oet1/sold_it_all_today_my_story_since_2013/,51,Bitcoin,119,"Well not all, but about 20 coins. I'm just writing this to get it off my chest.

Here's my story:

After missing my buy at $20 in early 2013 due to my laziness of having to sign up for an exchange, I didn't let my chance slip up later that year: I bought at the peak of the boom in late 2013. I ended up averaging in at about $800 for 40+ BTC ($35k total). I had been successful in an online business, and as a young kid I decided to throw half of my net worth into this magic internet money. I didn't understand the concept of decentralization back then, but I liked the idea of an internet currency, it made sense and I loved taking risks so I went for it.

Well shortly after that I discovered Dogecoin (or was it created then?) so naturally I dumped ALL my BTC into it thinking this meme coin would be an even better form of internet money. Over a year or two I watched my crypto dwindle down to sub $2k. At that point I was thinking alright might as well let it go to 0. I eventually switched it all back over to BTC when it went back up to 7-8k (IIRC), but at this point I lost a few BTC, I was down to 30-35 or so. A couple of other memories include spending 0.3 BTC on a porn subscription when BTC was worth $200 or so. I also sent 0.25 BTC to a website that said they would send 1 BTC back, needless to say I'm still patiently waiting for them to send it back. Lost a couple of coins at that casino that was up in 2014 as well, but I forgot the name of it.

Anyway, 2017 rolls around, and I break even! I had moved on in my life at this point and having 35k was nice but not life changing, so I never thought about selling at that point... But then that year it just kept climbing and climbing. Once my portfolio hit 100k was when it hit me that something special was going on. I was incessantly checking the prices at work and did more and more research about decentralization and understanding what Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies really were. And that's when I discovered altcoins...

Thinking I was ahead of the curve I threw all my BTC into alts right after the BTC Cash fork. Within the next month my \~40 BTC dropped down to 15 (but it stayed about even in $) while BTC was mooning. Dec 2017/Jan 2018 comes and it rockets up to 75 BTC! My portfolio was worth over a million dollars. Wow. I was right in my thinking and I was rewarded for it. Everyone was talking about crypto at that point and I started throwing a BTC into all sorts of alts and ICOs.

Luckily I also reluctantly sold 15BTC to lock in some profits, but feared I'd miss the next rally hence the small amount. Turned out to be a good idea - that was the top. Scam after scam, the rest of my coins run down to 20 or so BTC. I was a millionaire on crypto-paper for about a month.

Over the next couple of years I ended up holding pure ETH as it eventually dwindled down to sub 100k. Depression hits and I see what could've been, kicking myself for not cashing out. But I knew there would be another bullrun one day so I didn't sell.

Fast forward to the COVID crash - I wake up one day to BTC at $3k and knew I had to trade it. My ETH was down to \~12BTC at the time, and being jobless and quarantined, I traded ""full time"" and ran it all the way up to 100+ BTC (on the way up from 3k-10k). I felt like a god, I called every move and I didn't lose. I was a millionaire again! But only for a moment...

I then went on to lose \~75 BTC margin trading. I was taking on ridiculous trades. From July 19 thru September I built up a 1000BTC long position (lol) which got me stopped out when it dipped back down to \~9800. My stop was at 9900 and I lost a massive amount of money. Had I not been stopped out I would've made 10-30 mil. But that's not how it works and I probably would've given it back one way or another. So with my last 25 BTC I forced myself to sit on my hands in spot while I watched it go up and up and up.

Anyway here I am now. I'm done riding the crypto rollercoaster. I have been fully exposed to crypto ever since learning about decentralization in 2017. And although I'm extremely bullish on crypto, I'm going to lock in some money so I have a stable lifestyle over the next decade+, as well as diversify my investments. It really does a number to you when your future is uncertain - life with 10k vs 100k vs 1mil vs 10mil net worth is very different, at least for me. I had let money control my mood and life goals over the past few years in both the ups and downs. But there is so much more to life than money and being glued to a screen. I sold about 20 coins for $35k average which will set me right for a very good amount of time. I'm out, I'm done stressing and having sleepless nights. I have major major FOMO that we'll ultra moon from here, but I can't take another cycle of this. A million dollars is a lot of money, and while 10m+ would be nice to have, this is life changing enough for me.

Good luck to y'all out there whether you've been around a while or are new to crypto. Crypto has gifted me freedom and I've learned so much over the years. Please remember to take care of yourselves. Bitcoin prices aren't everything.

The best thing money can buy you is an awakening to your potential, and for that I am thankful. The real work begins now.

&#x200B;

TLDR;

35k->2k->1mil->50k->1mil, potentially 10+m->1m->I'm OUT

BTC>USD,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l22uw6/btcusd/,3,Bitcoin,0,"BTC>USD 

I think it’s time we ask ourselves as a community some important questions:

Why do we accept the VALUE of Bitcoin as its portrayed in US dollars quoted by companies which are backed by Banks (i.e Coinbase etc). After all these organizations have a clear conflict of interest with respect to Bitcoin’s success as they are direct competition to bitcoin in that they literally create the dollars in which our BTC trades against.

To answer that question, I think we need to ask another important question:

Why would banks back these exchanges to begin with? 

Well, in my opinion it comes down to two things.

1) They know that the bitcoin genie is out of the bottle and cannot be put back.

and 

2) It's a last-ditch effort by the banks to control the price of bitcoin in their currency (USD) before bitcoin becomes the world's standard of value for the people.

So, if that is in fact the reality, then how can we break our bitcoin free from the grasps of these powerful organization's control over the price in USD of our BTC? 

Fortunately, I believe there is a very simple answer: 

Take physical possession of your own BTC private keys ASAP regardless of how little or how much bitcoin you have on these exchanges. 

These exchanges can and will maintain USD control of the price of bitcoin as long as they run the exchanges that hold the largest tradeable supply of bitcoin.

Remember supply and demand will ultimately determine the value of anything and with bitcoin being the first truly finite asset in history which was front run by Main St by a group ideologically aligned to the peaceful revolution that can BTC can bring it has them scared!

Think for a moment about how truly ironic it is that the masses are allowing these organizations (bank backed exchanges) to tell us the value in of our BTC in USD and we just accept that at face value.  Really?  The USD?  Fiat currency? The ones in which are infinitely inflated by all fiat producers (central banks) racing each other towards the bottom producing trillions and trillions of these worthless digital notes?  Well, that doesn’t add up to me..at least at face value.

Don't be tricked bye these organizations and let the currently quoted USD amount per Bitcoin displayed by the bank backed exchanges tell you what the VALUE of bitcoin is.  Once folks understand that bitcoin is not about dollars but about true power then I believe people will start to look at buying bitcoin at whatever USD price is.  Don’t let the banks conflate the value of our BTC with USD any longer.  There is a better system of value.  BTC>USD. 

Take this fleeting window of opportunity to secure yourselves and your loved ones future positions in the world by simply moving your keys to your own wallets that you control and do it ASAP! Time is truly of the essence.  Just look at the recent headlines and you’ll see how they are trying to start closing the gates.  

Together WE can and will show them the true VALUE of our peaceful BITCOIN revolution!",2021-01-22 06:46:33

Please watch the 4 yr cycle of bitcoin by bob loukas and his latest video.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l29krm/please_watch_the_4_yr_cycle_of_bitcoin_by_bob/,0,Bitcoin,8,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWdOztDkv4

His latest video Jan 9th 2021

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBxMIT2D_Ko

Bob loukas' analysis nailed the bottom of the bear market of late 2018/early 2019...

He studied the previous 4 yr cycles/halvings, and specifically nailed the start of the next 4 yr cycle of 2019.

If you watched this and followed his analysis you would have entered bitcoin at less than 4k/btc.

You would have accumulated all of 2019 and 2020.

He advises buy dips, of 2019/20....

He talks about selling as the bull run moves in year three (2021)of the cycle.... Selling portions of your position as it climbs up...

He advises having an exit strategy or price points as it climbs...

Though he is bullish on btc in this current cycle, he does not want to make absolute price positions...

But he does see this bull cycle topping in between 100k and 250k....

Most importantly to me is the bear market that is in the final year of the 4yr cycle...

In the bear market the previous retracements have been 70-80%....

I followed this advice from March of 2019... When I was homeless, with little extra fiat to invest.

The next cycle I will be more prepared.

Is this an absolute in bitcoin.... No.

Does he make a reasonable proven example... Yes.

Some people believe there is not a 4yr cycle, but instead a set of lengthening cycles... Is this true? Who knows? Only years more of btc will prove it.

Watch all of bobs videos, and he will tell you his position.... That he added to it in March 20, and how he plans his exit plan...

Is he a god, a guru, a perfect analyst.... No.

But he did nail the bottom/start of the 4 yr cycle... And if you would have followed his advice you would be holding btc at buy ins of 4k...up... And in positive territory with returns in 100%(8k), 200%(16k), and 300%(at 32k).

Please study this, it may change your life, or your investment strategy.

Best wishes....blessings to all.

Thank you bob loukas... You helped change my life.",2021-01-22 12:04:17

But it casted my mind to the [Railway Mania Bubble](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_Mania) and the [Dot-com Bubble](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble).

The Railway bubble left substantial infrastructure that helped the future economic growth.

The dot-com Bubble did something similar with the abundance of high speed/bandwidth internet.

Could the argument be said that Bitcoin in the short term may be detrimental, but as people create ""free"" power through renewables to make mining more profitable it will inturn advance the abundance of ""free"" power in the long term.

The multiple is of the price values of the 350DMA not the number of days. For the past three market cycles, when the 111DMA moves up and crosses the 350DMA x 2 we see that it coincides with the price of Bitcoin peaking. It is also interesting to note that 350 / 111 is 3.153, which is very close to Pi = 3.142. In fact, it is the closest we can get to Pi when dividing 350 by another whole number.

We've all heard the ""not your keys, not your bitcoin"".

Beyond the risks of exchange confiscation or exit scams, there's another reason to hodl your btc in your own hardware wallet. It's to make it impossible for institutions to sell fake bitcoin IOUs, artificially inflating the perceived supply of btc. It's impossible to prove if any given exchange is actually holding enough btc in reserve to satisfy their deposits, but the more people that hold their btc in an exchange, the greater the opportunity for exchanges to scam or ""rehypothecate"" their btc.

We've all heard the importance of ""getting off zero"" by just buying some non-zero amount of btc.

Well the next stage is getting off zero with respect to your direct custody of your own coins.

You don't need to store all your btc in a hardware or phone wallet, but at least shift some of your btc to a hardware wallet.

You'll be doing a favor to yourself and to the entire btc network, and sticking it to the would-be middlemen scammers for whom bitcoin was designed to put out of the job.

every satoshi in your own wallet is one less satoshi available to rehypothecate. One less satoshi of fraud, theft and systemic risk in the world.

(rehypothecate = the exchange is using a same amount of btc to back deposits for a larger amount of btc than they actually have)",2021-01-22 01:07:39

If we as a species survive the next 10, 20, 30 years we will most certainly have started mining on nearby asteroids. The ones we mine first will be the ones we know for sure have valuable ingredients inside them. How we do this is why I have made a three decade wide guess as to when this type of mining will become possible and put into use. Could be longer. What I am slowly getting to is the fact that asteroids are incredibly plentiful in our planet’s general neighborhood and many will have gold within them. Look up the asteroid named 16 Psyche. That’s just ONE. Asteroid mining will dilute the entire precious metals market overnight. That’s a bold statement, but understanding the insane number of asteroids nearby and the fact that most if not all have some precious metals in them makes it really just a simple thing to say. What happens to the price of gold when a spaceship shows up one Tuesday carrying multiple tons of gold? I’d think the value might dip a bit. All I’m saying is this is yet another reason why Bitcoin is so important for the future of humanity.

One Bitcoin used to cost less than a chicken nugget.

Imagine if you have only 21 million chicken nuggets to feed the entire world. Some people will never get to taste one.

How lucky would you be to share a 6-piece nuggets with your family?

Grayscale is the new McDonald's and is singing ""I'm lovin' it!""

So remember, when crazy people sell their nuggets and Bitcoin dips into the red BBQ sauce, it gets  even more delicious. You BUY and HODL. Don't worry, these chicken nuggets never go bad and last forever.

"Confused about Crypto and UK capital gains, Any advice appreciated...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l1umb6/confused_about_crypto_and_uk_capital_gains_any/,3,Bitcoin,18,"Sorry for any stupid questions in advance, I'm just quite confused. I have only just realised there are possibly capital gains implications from 2017 when I got into crypto, mostly losses in my case although I'm not really sure...heres the story

\- Bought a fair amount of BTC, ETH and LTC in 2017 a week before the crash, and obviously lost a lot on paper instantly but held it.

\- I then went a bit mad buying and selling alts, on a variety of exchanges, no idea what I was doing. But I'm almost certain every trade was a loss or negligible profit.

\- After a few months of bad decisions I decided to stop and then waited 3 years holding my BTC and collection of alts until now.

so...

• If I am almost certain I made nearly no profitable trades from one crypto to another or to fiat in 2017/2018/2019 then I just dont have to do anything right? Or should I be trying to add up any losses to set off against future profits? How long do I have to declare past losses and how far into the future can you offset those losses against any gains?

• My plan now is to hold the majority of it for the next few years. But then what is my cost basis for the coins I hold? Especially if I bought BTC, made a variety of bad trades in and out of alts and then back to BTC. Does that change my cost basis of my BTC? Or do I just base it on my original BTC buys, the average cost of them all, and then calculate the profit based on whatever price I sell some for in the future?

• Are there any ways to minimise the CG tax I will have to pay if I want to take profits this year or in the coming years? I lost a lot of money from bad decisions. If I had just bought BTC and ETH and her it until now, I would have doubled my money. But right now I've only recently broken even, which is the proof of all my bad trades. But if I just use the original cost basis of the BTC I bought, then none of those bad trades would be taken into account as far as CG tax goes. But is it too far in the past anyway?

• Finally I bought a variety of coins at ICO, sending ETH to their addresses, most of which didn't do very well, and a few went to zero and were scams. How are ICOs treated when it comes to tax?

Sorry, its hard to explain and I'm super confused, but if anyone could make sense of this, I'd be hugely grateful

After an hour with the President I think I made believers out of them,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l29cug/after_an_hour_with_the_president_i_think_i_made/,0,Bitcoin,20,"My friend's Mom works in the Whitehouse and knows that I'm interested in Bitcoin so when they had a report come up involving a report. I was called into the President's Oval Office for a meeting. I was surprised that both President and Vice-President of the United States were there and the VC quickly admitted that they had only heard about Bitcoin in the news but that they didn't really know anything about it.

I talked with them about Bitcoin's origins after the banking crisis and it's potential use as a reserve currency or a hedge against inflation. I described the Fed's policy on quantitative easing and they leaned in to listen closely. We talked about how Bitcoin differs from gold in terms of utility and security, but is similar in terms of scarcity and the properties from which its value is determined. I glossed over how all of their account records are centralized and shared only with their partner institutions, but introduced them to the decentralized nature of blockchain and how the open, distributed ledger of Bitcoin is much less anonymous than some state actors would like them to believe.

By the end of our hour-long meeting the President leaned in and said, ""Jill, who the f**k is this dog-faced pony soldier and where am I?"". I like to think he was thanking me for my service to the country. I told the VC I'm happy to come back and talk anytime because we still have important concepts such as mining and other blockchain applications to go over. When I stepped out of the room the Whitehouse staff were lined up, they clapped, I clapped, the dog clapped. We should remember to never be afraid to share our knowledge with those who have questions about blockchain and crypto. It seems to me like the best way to encourage adoption.

HODLing is retarded,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l2e1vs/hodling_is_retarded/,0,Bitcoin,59,"I always see the mentality of ""just HODL"", this is beyond stupid. I assume everyone here believes in bitcoin long term, which is why the goal should be to accumulate as many bitcoins as possible. HODLing does the opposite of this, your number of bitcoins will remain the same for as long as you HODL. What you need to do is to sell and rebuy during crashes like the current one. People often say ""you can't time the market"", sure, you don't have to, there is only 1 rule: as long as you rebuy at a lower price than the one you sold at, you made a good trade because you will end up with more bitcoins than you originally had (without using extraneous cash to buy more). Note that the only skill here is to learn when you sell, but this can be learned fairly easily. **Rebuying does NOT take skill here, you DO NOT have to time your rebuy.** Remember, the goal isn't to sell at the peak and buy at the lowest point, the goal is to merely buy lower than you sold, it's literally **always** a good trade if this is true. What this means is that the ONLY way for this method to result in you losing money is if you sell at the LITERAL lowest point, this is statistically highly unlikely.  Stop HODLing, learn to do some trading. If you aren't willing to risk anything you will never be rich. I've made about 10 ethers **for free** now doing this (I only trade eth but same applies to btc).

EDIT: thought I'd add a point regarding tax, forgot to mention this since I've been trading on dexes for so long. Wrap your bitcoin and trade on 1inch or other dexes, don't trade on coinbase etc otherwise you will have to pay taxes on each trade. ",2021-01-22 16:04:08

The private key that was used for Tor v2 (if any) will be  left untouched in the `onion_private_key` file in the data directory (see  `-datadir`) and can be removed if not needed. Bitcoin Core will no longer  attempt to read it. The private key for the Tor v3 service will be saved in a  file named `onion_v3_private_key`. To use the deprecated Tor v2 service (not  recommended), the `onion_private_key` can be copied over  `onion_v3_private_key`, e.g.  `cp -f onion_private_key onion_v3_private_key`.

"If Bitcoin isn't for criminals, maybe it's good Ross Ulbright is in prison",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l29xh3/if_bitcoin_isnt_for_criminals_maybe_its_good_ross/,0,Bitcoin,17,"A popular criticism of Bitcoin is that it is used for crime, tax evasion, money laundering and so on. 

As we all know, it isn't good for that, cash is better as cash isn't as easy to trace nor is it public. If anything bitcoin makes makes the financial system more accountable by making all transactions more visible and traceable
 
r/Bitcoin tries to reduce the ""crazies"" that imply Bitcoin going to undermine the government via tax evasion or anarchist type things like darknet markets. 

So, maybe we should change the narrative and stop seeing Ross as a hero: instead he can be a poster child for the important bitcoin message: hey! Bitcoin isn't about committing crime, it isn't about funding domestic terrorists, it IS about being public, verifiable and making everyone including our politicians, government and people responsible and accountable for their actions. 


It is hypocritical to say bitcoin isn't for crime when we also support Ross Ulbright/Silkroad which was a completely criminal enterprise.

Fees can sometimes be low, sometimes get quite high, but of course you can choose your preferred fee depending on the time preference. 

I had an idea: is there a wallet app that uses a buffer, let's say its own mempool, to aggregate its users' transactions in order to batch send them and pay only 1 fee instead of X?

I know it centralizes some control, but couldn't a decentralized solution for this be created?

Saw another post about GBTC's premium down to nearly 0% today. There could be some decent discounts in store...,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l1mvbz/saw_another_post_about_gbtcs_premium_down_to/,6,Bitcoin,4,"Part of why it appears that Grayscale is buying such an enormous amount of Bitcoin every day is because part of the daily totals include Bitcoin that institutions are sending to Grayscale in exchange for GBTC. Why would institutions do this? In hopes of selling 6 months later (the required holding period for this type of exchange) and then capturing the premium. All around, a very nice arbitrage opportunity that has been going on for years.

Without the premium, though, why would these institutions pay Grayscale 2% per year (the expense ratio) to hold their coins? Many won't, which could force the price lower. Even selling GBTC at a discount might be reasonable to avoid paying that 2% per year. 

When that happens, other investors may jump on the sell band-wagon because they aren't going to understand what is going on (or worse, think that something has gone awry at Grayscale), which could create some panic selling.

Every single transaction between banks into the future will require the escrow of bitcoin to facilitate that instant payment.

What are some improvements we need to make to Bitcoin to ensure it succeeds?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l1g26n/what_are_some_improvements_we_need_to_make_to/,6,Bitcoin,20,"Hey Everyone,

I feel like I am somewhat new to crypto compared to many of you, but I have at least followed Bitcoin since 2011 and have observed how things have changed over the years, only seriously ""getting in"" last year.

In this time I have noticed a few things which stick out to me as needing to be addressed (and maybe they will be in time or are already, I do not know). The purpose of this post is to open some dialogue for discussion. These are items I believe prevent Bitcoin from currently essentially rendering altcoins completely obsolete.

1) Bitcoin is too slow - Waiting to get a transaction confirmed for 30 minutes is simply not acceptable in today's financial world, where customers can tap their debit cards for instant payment in FIAT - this will need to be made at the very slowest something like a 10 second confirmation before it is able to compete with some of these quicker coins.

2) The fees are far too high - It seems like this is something that has improved over the years, however it is highly obvious to anyone that $5 per transaction is too much, regardless of your income or wealth level. Getting this down to a few satoshis at maximum is essential for full adoption.

3) There is more lost bitcoin than unmined bitcoin - This is something that is only now going to start causing issues. As mining slows down and people start putting more importance on this locked and lost bitcoin, we may want a way to free this back up into the network for everyone else. I assume at some point we will need to have some type of decision made on removing any coins let's say that have not been moved in 50+ years back into the chain to allow for the 21M coin limit to be accurate and maintained. A legitimate person who was actually holding for 50+ years would have no issue making a simple transaction to keep their coins active. especially given adequate notice (let's say 10 years).

&#x200B;

Otherwise I really don't see anything preventing this from completely replacing FIAT in the years to come. I would love to hear discussion/thoughts on this.",2021-01-21 08:40:05

This Time its different /s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l0xxdz/this_time_its_different_s/,106,Bitcoin,60,"I see more and more posts about how this bull run is completely different compared to the previous ones. I heard „this time its different“ in 2013 and 2017. people where so euphoric seeing bitcoin go up and up that they thought they are the next warren buffet cause the price will go up and never go down. Then the drop happens and you can see posts saying bitcoin is their worst investment ever, how they lost all their money and crypto going to zero. This is when we enter the bear cycle.
And this bull run is no different. We will hit a peak 100k? 150k? 200k? No one knows but it won’t go up forever we WILL have another bear cycle and then the next bull cycle after the halving 2024. 

Now I’m hearing a lot „but what about the institutional investors. They will change everything!!!“. Yes it’s big that let’s say grayscale buys huge amounts of bitcoin but institutional investors are holding longterm! They know the price will be in the millions in 10 years, they don’t care when the Price Hits 150k and then drops back to 40k, they will just buy more. 

Don’t underestimate retail investors. Institutional investors are building the base, the retail investors will push it to the peak because every grandmother will invest when the price hits 60, 80, 100k but they are also the biggest weakhands who will sell when the price starts dropping. 

The safest approach is to buy and just hodl. Come back in 10 years and be a happy man/girl.
But it’s also not wrong to follow the cycles and selling on the way up when the price triples in one day at the peak and then buy more coins, when it’s going down.

Just don’t buy and expect to be a millionaire in a month. This will crush your dreams

1) How can Bitcoin be an effective store of value / everyday currency if its price is so volatile? I understand that it's an emerging technology so volatility is to be expected at first, but at what point does price stabilize to the extent that it can be used in daily transactions or as a stable store of value / unit of account?

2) A lot of proponents of Bitcoin point towards its inherently decentralized / anti-authoritarian nature, as well as how the use of Bitcoin can help encourage democratization and equality among its users. How is this possible if only 2% of Bitcoin accounts hold 95% of the currency? It seems like this would contribute to massive price volatility and an unhealthy concentration of currency in the hands of the both the biggest and earliest adopters.

3) What is the endgame of Bitcoin (and crypto in general)? It seems to me that banks serve important functions in terms of facilitating loans / lending, which helps circulate massive amounts of otherwise ""dormant"" money into new startups, real estate acquisitions, and more. With Bitcoin, how would this be affected? Will local banks be forced to evolve and offer savings and loan services related to crypto, even though this would defeat the decentralized purpose of cryptocurrency in the first place?

Buying GBTC primary shares (with the proceeds of secondary market GBTC),https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l1guv7/buying_gbtc_primary_shares_with_the_proceeds_of/,2,Bitcoin,0,"Hi, new here.  I just really fully understood the structure of GBTC.  I have some questions about actually buying shares of the fund (Primary market) and advantages/cons of this vs holding BTC in my Trezor or owning GBTC shares (bought on the secondary market, with premium).

Situation:

I meet the criteria to be an accredited investor.  I have about 6% of my investments, in BTC/GBTC, 1/2 in an IRA with GBTC and 1/2 as coin in my custody (taxable).  Both of these have appreciated enough so that I could meet the minimum to buy direct shares of GBTC, with cash contribution in the IRA/to stay in the IRA, or the minimum amount of Bitcoin to give in-kind for shares at NAV (not the price of the shares with the premium on the secondary market).  Both of these transactions would be non taxable (one is in an IRA and the other is in-kind, which is not taxable)

So, if I buy actual shares or exchange BTC for shares, I get them at the discount w/o premium (the NAV).  After 6 months, they could be sold on the secondary market, but it is highly likely by there there is an BTC ETF and there would be no premium. 

It doesn't make sense to trade actual Bitcoin for shares to me (I would just be paying them a 2% yearly fee in that case).  It seems like the only way to make money with this transaction is to bet on there still being a premium after 6 months.  The only reason to do it is if I was fearful of having them in my own custody (I am comfortable with a wallet)

However could I take the GBTC shares I own, sell them, use USD in the IRA to buy primary shares of GBTC, and end up with 15% or whatever the premium is more shares?  I would have to hold them for 6 months.  By then the premium may be nothing if there are Bitcoin ETFs, but I would still have more shares than I began with.  There has likely been some smart money doing this for years, but it will come to an end with ETFs, but it seems like it would make sense as long as there is still a premium.

Problems with this?  How would I buy them from my IRA, one of which is with Etrade and one of which is with Vanguard?  Would I have to create a new with Grayscale?  Do they act as an IRA custodian?  I just don't understand where I could place these primary shares, since they are not listed on exchanges, etc.  I would not want to withdraw cash from the IRA, but rather to a rollover to keep taxes simple.  

Silly idea or is it possible for a relatively small investor to do this at least once, until an ETF appears?",2021-01-21 09:16:59

Moral Obligation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l1krih/moral_obligation/,1,Bitcoin,0,"If you get Bitcoin, you understand we have a moral obligation to protect the network against all attacks, for us and the betterment of humanity.

What Janet Yellen and Christiane Lagarde said hurt me a lot. I know the bitcoin network is still going to be a strong network even if the government regulates it immensely or outright bans it, but there is a real threat that what they will do will set us back at least a couple of years in terms of proliferation and adoption. 

I urge you all, please reach out to your senators, and tell them how you feel! Your voice is a powerful tool, and if we all speak up, we can start changing our government's mind on it - hopefully. Find out how to contact your senator here:

>Frankly, I don't really reach out to senators but I wanted my voice to be heard on a matter that I'm passionate about. The truth is I read something that hurt me, and I had to do something about it as I have a moral obligation as a human to fight for what’s right. The thing that hurt me was that Janet Yellen, our incoming treasury secretary saying bitcoin was being used to fund terrorism and money laundering and we needed to curtail it. In Europe, Chrisitiane Lagarde, basically Janet’s counterpart, said the same thing.   
>  
>They are completely and unequivocally wrong. It’s like saying terrorists use planes to get around the world to pull off their attacks and governments need to curtail airplanes as a result. We can't let ignorance dim out the light of innovation. Janet Yellen, and people that are fighting against bitcoin are on the wrong side of history. It truly is a fight between light and darkness, like Biden said during the presidential election trail.

>There is so much good that bitcoin is doing for the world, and it has much more to do. Alex Goldstein of the Human Rights Foundation said “bitcoin is becoming a more viable tool for pro-democracy movements worldwide” in places like Nigeria, Hong Kong, Belarus, Russia. These movements, who would be normally cut off from the central banks of their governments, are using bitcoin as a medium of exchange. “Democracy is fragile” says Joe Biden, and bitcoin strengthens it all around the world. Bitcoin is a humanity changing invention - one that can bring considerable benefits to all of mankind. Our state, and America, can become even greater by adopting and figuring out how to integrate with Bitcoin.

"Hello everyone, especially those new to the space",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l0x0t5/hello_everyone_especially_those_new_to_the_space/,33,Bitcoin,27,"This is an attempt at explaining Bitcoin for newcomers from a non-technical point of view. 

There is a lot of confusion about what it is and is not and I would like to share my perspective. I welcome additions and or/corrections and criticisms as I too am trying to expand my understanding by attempting this post. 

Bitcoin is a way to transfer value from one
location to another fast and reliably, and without the need to rely on a third party like a bank. The higher authority here is computer calculations and as you know those are extremely accurate. As a result, it costs less to make payments than traditional banks because there are fewer issues with the payments. This is valuable in and of itself but perhaps more importantly, it allows you to hedge against inflation by storing value. 

As the US government prints more and more money, the value of the USD decreases and inflation increases. Storing value is like buying gold, or better yet, buying a house as an investment. The idea being that by the time you need to sell (far in the future) it is worth much more than you paid and can buy at least the same amount of goods if not more as you could when you invested. While, in contrast, if you just held on to your Dollars you would undoubtably be able to buy less than before due to inflation. 

Last but not least, unlike houses and gold, which can be created with hard work, bitcoin is capped at a supply of 21million. Imagine if there was a cap on how much gold or how many houses there were in the world? The price of those things would have to only go up over time. This is the fate of bitcoin. The other issue with houses and gold as stores of value is the fact that they’re very hard to divide. Bitcoin is extremely divisible. Imagine if you could buy just $5-$10 of gold or a house whenever you got some spare cash? It would certainly do a lot better over the long term than a savings account. 

PS. The 1% in this country that hold all the wealth want nothing more than to keep it. If bitcoin makes it big, it will be a major rebalancing of that equation as a lot of us early adopters become rich. It’s certainly not too late and all it needs to succeed is for enough people to believe in it. We’re getting there and the more informed people are, the better progress we’re making towards this becoming an integral part of the international monetary system. 

Please feel free to message me with any questions I’d be happy to field them.",2021-01-20 13:40:35

Is it reasonable to be suspicious of Grayscale?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l165dn/is_it_reasonable_to_be_suspicious_of_grayscale/,4,Bitcoin,13,"First of all, I'm not suggesting I know the answer to this. I would simply like clarification, which Grayscale has refused to give so far.

Everyone seems to be a Grayscale fan-boy/girl these days. I’m not so sure.

Have you noticed how Grayscale seems to avoid stating its BTC holdings in actual BTC?  Instead, it always publishes the dollar value of its Assets Under Management (AUM). Does anyone else see the bizarre choice here, in publishing the ever-fluctuating value rather than the finite number of Bitcoins?

I've asked them, including [the CEO](https://twitter.com/Sonnenshein), many, many times where I can find the actual number, to confirm it's not a fractional fund, but they've just ignored me, which makes me more suspicious.

Indeed, the supposed-amount may be calculated from [Shares Outstanding x Bitcoin per Share](https://grayscale.co/bitcoin-trust/), which was 666,675,200 x 0.00094913 = 632,761 for 19/01/2021, but why not be absolutely clear, unless there's something to hide? I just cannot fathom the reason why it would be omitted from this page.

Incidentally, ByBit has a very nice summary of all the Grayscale data, [here](https://www.bybt.com/Grayscale), although I believe it relies on the same calculation above.

It's very possible that the information is out there somewhere, but I simply haven't found it. However, this is also the problem - I'd ideally like the company to be transparent, by stating the number clearly on its website, or in its official releases, like [this one](https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1351647612248748032/photo/1) on twitter. 

A while ago I asked a similar question about Paypal, and there were some rational answers that satisfied the concerns. Hopefully, the same will happen here.",2021-01-20 23:22:55

Transferred bitcoins to USDT account - Bitcoins lost...,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l195lw/transferred_bitcoins_to_usdt_account_bitcoins_lost/,3,Bitcoin,10,"Hi all,

I want to reach out to you because I'm getting desperate about bitcoins I sent to my account back in 2017 which never arrived...

In short:  
I bought 0.2 bitcoin back in 2017 via BTCdirect. I thought being clever to send them to my USDT account in Bittrex as it could take some time untill they arrived on my account and doing so I wanted to avoid the fluctuations in the market. How could I know that usdt accounts could not receive bitcoins?... (Now I do...). However, they never arrived in my account.

I tried to contact the Bittrex support several times but they allways waved me off and told me that the amount of bitcoins was to small to take the risk and try to recover them.

Besides the fact that I don't believe that it's difficult to recover the bitcoins - I would think that the advantages of blockhain would make it easier to recover them - some other strange things came to my eyes when I dive in the transaction again:

In the blockchain I can see that the bitcoins arrived in my account at 2017-10-22 21:50. However, about 3 hours later, at 2017-10-23 00:57, the same amount was sent in 2 transactions to 2 adresses: ±0.005BTC to adress 1 and ±0.186BTC to adress 2.  
However, both transactions do not appear in my order history on Bittrex.  
Furthermore both adresses have allready received a huge amount of bitcoins so I suppose this is a Bittrex account.

I'm a bit desperate right now as it seems like I'm completely depending on the help of Bittrex. Therefore 2 questions for you:

\- Do you think it is easy/possible for them to recover the bitcoins?  
\- Which other steps can I take to try to recover the bitcoins?

Allready a big thanks to everyone who takes the time to read my post and formulate an answer! Much appreciated!

Best regards,

I want to clear up one of the largest misconceptions about GBTC. 80% of their newly issued shares are through BTC purchases NOT USD purchases,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l0r9py/i_want_to_clear_up_one_of_the_largest/,54,Bitcoin,35,"I see this common misconception a ton and Grayscale doesn't seem to want to clear it up, imo this is intentional. GBTC allows what is called an in kind purchase, where you send them BTC and they issue you the amount of shares at the end of the day. 

This is not a taxable event and you can sell it on the market (for a premium in the past) after a 6 month period, you have to be an accredited investor though. In the past when the premium was higher than the taxes the seller would incur, they could hypothetically sell the coins and make money or pay less taxes. This arbitrage is what many people are doing to raise their cost averages.

They don't release the numbers of in kind purchases versus USD purchases, but from the last time they did at the end of 2019 it was 80% in kind versus 20% USD. I believe this ratio is more or less the same or only slightly higher as I have asked them multiple times to release the numbers, but they wont. 

So when you see headlines like ""GBTC buys 700M worth of bitcoin!"", realize only 20% of that is probably USD purchased.

Edit: Theres a fantastic thread on bitcointalk [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5256529.0) about everything you need to know about GBTC. Scroll down to the in kind buying section for most of the proof.",2021-01-20 09:03:15

Account Security: Protect yourselves against investment schemes

The Blockchain technology provides endless possibilities for innovations and solutions to revolutionize our way of living. Like most tools, there are people who make good use of it and those who abuse it. To safeguard yourself from falling victim into investment scams, below list some red flags you can watch out for.  
General tips to avoid investment schemes :  
• Claims to give quick, consistent and high returns. Any investment that guarantees a high return on investment as much as 15-30% per year or 1.25 -2.5% monthly is doubtfully legitimate.  
• The majority of your returns come from inviting other people. The more people you invite, the higher your returns. But do not confuse this with the Affiliate or Referral programs provided by some exchanges.  
• No or minimal transparency regarding the business model or the investment strategy.  
• Information on the investment is not easily accessible i.e. you need to register to find out.  
• It is not clear who founds the business.  
• If the investment involves coins, and that their coins are not listed on Coinmarketcap  
Their websites are listed on scam list.",2021-01-20 18:56:02

to cut a long story short, other deposits to the same address have a similar pattern re change address, so following the very first deposit back,

the first step is to an address (which also seems to receive some pool mining dust? or perhaps a faucet? in 2013 - 30 sats to some addresses )
